After:

function dice(faces,target,combat=0){
	if (faces==10 ) {
		number = Math.floor(Math.random()*faces)
	} else {
		number = Math.floor(Math.random()*(faces-1))+1

		number = Math.round(20*document.getElementById('votes').value/(document.getElementById('judge').value-3));
	} else {
		number = 20
	}
	if (number==0) {

	document.getElementById('DC').value = number;
	document.getElementById('DC').innerHTML = number;

Q(start): What role are you playing today?
A: The Judge
	Q(1.1):GOTO:judge
A: An attorney
	Q(1.2):GOTO:attorney
A: A fractional judge
	Q(1.3):GOTO:fractional

Q(judge): Great, I'll help you guide gameplay. Before we start, how many people in your group, including yourself?
X:
	Q(DC): Do you have two attorneys? 
	A: Yes
		Q(2.1.1):GOTO:sim
	A: No
		Q(2.1.2): Ask for volunteers, if you can't easily decide on two attorneys, have everyone role their D20. The two people with the highest rolls are the two attorneys. To break any ties, have folks roll again. Once you have your attorneys, click Continue.
		A: Continue
			Q(2.1.2.1):GOTO:sim

Q(sim): Your job is to work through the relevant issues. 
A: Got it
	Q(3.1): Have the moving party start by explaining why they should get what they want. Ask their opponents to counter, and make sure both sides have their chance to rebut. Feel free to push back and ask clarifying questions. GOTO:votes

Q(votes): Once they've finished. Poll the fractional judges (everyone but the attorneys and yourself) to see how many of them think the NON-moving party should prevail. Record the votes below.
X[javascript:getDC()]:
	Q(4.1):Have the moving party roll their D20. To succeed, they need to roll <b><x>DC</x></b> or higher.
	A[javascript:goto(dice(20,'jroll'))]: I need to roll for them
	A: They succeeded
		Q(4.1.2): Narrate their success. GOTO:again
	A: They failed
		Q(4.1.3): Narrate their failure. GOTO:again

Q(jroll): <span class="dice"><x>start</x></span>
A: They succeeded
	Q(5.1): Narrate their success. GOTO:again
A: They failed
	Q(5.2): Narrate their failure. GOTO:again

Q(again): Choose the next issue and have the attorneys argue it. Decide who you want to have to roll and ask the fractional judges if they think their opponent will prevail. Record the votes below.
X[javascript:getDC()]:
	Q(6.1):Have the attorney roll their D20. To succeed, they need to roll <b><x>DC</x></b> or higher.
	A[javascript:goto(dice(20,'jroll'))]: I need to roll for them
	A: They succeeded
		Q(6.1.2): Narrate their success. GOTO:again
	A: They failed
		Q(6.1.3): Narrate their failure. GOTO:again
A: We don't have any more arguments
	Q(6.2): You're all done.

Q(attorney):GOTO:dice

Q(dice): Wait for instructions from the judge. If you need to roll a D20, go ahead.
A[javascript:goto(dice(20,'rolled'))]: Roll

Q(rolled): <span class="dice"><x>start</x></span>
A[javascript:goto(dice(20,'rolled'))]: Roll

Q(fractional): Your job is pretty straightforward. All you have to do is listen to the arguments from both attorneys and vote on which ones should prevail when polled by The Judge. That's it.
