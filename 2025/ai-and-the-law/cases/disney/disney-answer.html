Defendant Midjourney, Inc. (“Midjourney”), by and through counsel, hereby
responds to the Complaint (“Complaint”) filed by Plaintiffs Disney Enterprises, Inc.,
Marvel Characters, Inc., MVL Film Finance LLC, Lucasfilm LTD. LLC, Twentieth
Century Fox Film Corporation, Universal City Studios Productions LLLP, and
Dreamworks Animation L.L.C. (together, “Plaintiffs”). Unless specifically admitted,
Midjourney denies each of the allegations in the Complaint.
<h2>STATEMENT</h2><br>
Founded in 2022, Midjourney is an artificial intelligence (“AI”) research lab
dedicated to creating tools that augment and expand the human imagination. Its
namesake generative AI platform does just that, empowering tens of millions of users—
including Plaintiffs—to express themselves in ways that otherwise would not have been
possible. For many, Midjourney has become an essential tool for bringing their ideas to
life, with users’ images having won awards, adorned magazine covers, appeared in
national ads, and served as the bases for set designs in an Oscar winning film.
The AI technology that powers Midjourney is a type of neural network designed
to produce original images in response to user instructions (“prompts”). To develop this
capability, Midjourney’s AI models had to be trained on billions of publicly available
images, which are paired with text descriptions, in order to learn visual concepts and
how they correspond to language. During training, complex statistical relationships
between visual features and words in the text-image pairs are encoded within the model,
enabling it to understand and accurately respond to user prompts.
This process is akin to how humans learn to draw or paint—not by memorizing
individual artworks, but by internalizing patterns and techniques through repeated
exposure and practice. Similarly, Midjourney’s models form a generalized
understanding of visual styles, objects, and compositions based on statistical
regularities in training data. When a user enters a prompt, the model doesn’t retrieve
an image from storage; rather, a new image is synthesized from scratch, guided by user
instruction and the statistical patterns encoded within its artificial neurons.
Plaintiffs, collectively representing two of the largest traditional media
companies in the world, have benefitted from and continue to benefit from
Midjourney and other, similar generative AI tools. Indeed, many dozens of
Midjourney subscribers are associated with Plaintiffs’ corporate email addresses, and
Midjourney is also a popular tool among the visual effects companies and other
vendors employed by Plaintiffs. As Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO, recently exclaimed
during a discussion about his company’s utilization of AI, “technology is an
invaluable tool for artists,” and generative AI is no different.
Years after its launch, Plaintiffs now take aim at Midjourney in two ways.
First, they allege that the process of training an AI model on billions of images
violates their rights, even though only a small fraction of those images may contain
individual frames from Plaintiffs’ films and shows. As a matter of equity, Plaintiffs
cannot have it both ways, seeking to profit—through their use of Midjourney and
other generative AI tools—from industry-standard AI training practices on the one
hand, while on the other hand accusing Midjourney of wrongdoing for the same. But
Plaintiffs are also wrong on the merits. Copyright law does not confer absolute
control over the use of copyrighted works. The limited monopoly granted by
copyright must give way to fair use, which safeguards countervailing public interests
in the free flow of ideas and information. Training a generative AI model to
understand concepts by extracting statistical information embedded in copyrighted
works is a quintessentially transformative fair use – a determination resoundingly
supported by courts that have considered the issue. See Kadrey v. Meta Platforms,
Inc., 2025 WL 1752484, at *12 (N.D. Cal. June 25, 2025) (describing training as
“highly transformative”); Bartz v. Anthropic PBC, 2025 WL 1741691, at *7 (N.D.
Cal. June 23, 2025) (calling training “spectacularly” transformative).
Second, Plaintiffs complain that Midjourney has created and displayed images
that incorporate characters from popular film and television series, that these images
are per se infringing, and that Midjourney is liable for their creation. But Plaintiffs’
framing is premised on mischaracterizations of how Midjourney works and its role
in the creative process. The Midjourney platform is an instrument for user
expression. It assists with the creation of images only at the direction of its users,
guided by their instructions, in what is often an elaborate and time-consuming
process of experimentation, iteration, and discovery.
And while Midjourney users are required by Midjourney’s Terms of Service
to refrain from infringing the intellectual property rights of others, including
Plaintiffs’ rights, Midjourney does not presuppose and cannot know whether any
particular image is infringing absent notice from a copyright owner and information
regarding how the image is used. Indeed, there are any number of legitimate, non-
infringing grounds to create images incorporating characters from popular culture
like those claimed by Plaintiffs, including non-commercial fan art, experimentation
and ideation, and social commentary and criticism. Plaintiffs seek to stifle them all.
Plaintiffs could have—and should have—followed Midjourney’s Digital
Millennium Copyright Act notice and takedown procedure, codified in its Terms of
Service, by identifying the specific images they believe are infringing and providing
the URLs where they are displayed. Doing so would have afforded any accused
Midjourney users the opportunity to respond. Instead, Plaintiffs made sweeping
allegations about Midjourney writ large, commenced this litigation, and are pursuing
a path that chills lawful expression.<br>
In the end, this case is not about Midjourney profiteering off of what Plaintiffs
call “infringement.” Midjourney isn’t. Nor is it about any purported “harm” to
Plaintiffs; they have identified none. Rather, this case is about whether Plaintiffs’
alleged copyrights entitle them to prohibit the use of their works to train generative
AI models, and to prevent the incorporation of elements of those works within the
creations of generative AI users, regardless of the contents of those creations and the
ultimate ends to which users put them. Plaintiffs are not so entitled. Copyright has
“always been closely connected with freedom of expression, on the one hand, and []
technological improvements in means of dissemination, on the other,” with the law
recognizing that limited use of copyrighted material to create new technologies and
mediums advances copyright’s ultimate objective: the stimulation of creative
expression for public benefit. Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464
U.S. 417, 431 fn. 12 (1984) (quotation omitted). As Midjourney will establish,
Plaintiffs’ overreach rests on fundamental misunderstandings of generative AI, its
role in user creation, and the principles underpinning copyright law.
As set forth below, Midjourney responds to the Complaint’s specific
allegations.<br>

“Prayer for Relief.” To the extent that the “Prayer for Relief” contains any
allegations, Midjourney denies the same.
<h2>DEFENSES</h2>
Midjourney asserts that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred, in whole or in part, by the
defenses set forth herein. The Preliminary Statement and responses above are
incorporated in these defenses by reference as if fully set forth herein. By setting
forth these defenses, Midjourney does not assume the burden of proving any fact,
issue, or element of a cause of action where such burden properly belongs to
Plaintiffs. Midjourney reserves the right to plead any and all defenses that may be
evident or revealed after investigation and discovery in this matter.
<h2>DEFENSE</h2>
To the extent that Midjourney made any unauthorized copies of Plaintiffs’
registered copyrighted works, or otherwise exercised any rights provided for under
17 U.S.C. § 106, such uses constitute fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107.
<h2>DEFENSE</h2>
Plaintiffs’ claims are barred, in whole or in part, to the extent that the Plaintiffs
do not own the copyrights for the asserted works, and/or otherwise lack standing to
assert the claims herein.
<h2>DEFENSE</h2>
Plaintiffs’ claims are barred, in whole or in part, on the ground that Plaintiffs
(themselves or through their agents) have licensed (actual or implied) one or more of
the asserted works to Midjourney.
<h2>DEFENSE</h2>
Plaintiffs’ claims are barred, in whole or in part, by the doctrines of
acquiescence, estoppel, and waiver. Midjourney is informed and believes, and on
that basis alleges, that one or more of the images that Plaintiffs allege infringe their
copyrights were created by Plaintiffs or agents thereof.
<h2>DEFENSE</h2>
Plaintiffs’ claims are barred, in whole or in part, by the doctrine of unclean
hands. Plaintiffs use and benefit from generative AI models, including Midjourney,
and including in connection with some or all of the asserted works. Moreover, on
information and belief, Plaintiffs are, like Midjourney, directly or indirectly engaged
in training generative AI models on publicly available works, some of which are
protected by copyrights owned by third parties. Accordingly, it would be inequitable
to permit Plaintiffs to benefit from the development and use of generative AI tools,
including Midjourney, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, prevent the
development and use of Midjourney by others.
<h2>DEFENSE</h2>
Plaintiffs’ claims are barred, in whole or in part, to the extent that any
purported copying of Plaintiffs’ protectable expression is de minimis.
<h2>DEFENSE</h2>
Plaintiffs’ claims are barred, in whole or in part, on the grounds that (i)
Plaintiffs have not provided Midjourney with adequate notice of specific instances
of purported copyright infringement by Midjourney users; and (ii) Midjourney is
entitled to avail itself to the infringement safe harbors codified in 17 U.S.C. § 512.
As alleged above, Plaintiffs have not complied with the provisions of the DMCA.
<h2>RELIEF</h2>
WHEREFORE, Midjourney asks this Court to enter judgment:
</p><p>
1. Dismissing the Complaint with prejudice;
</p><p>
2. Finding that Plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief requested in the
Complaint, or to any relief whatsoever, including for direct, contributory, or vicarious
copyright infringement;
</p><p>
3. Finding that one or more of the copyrights asserted by Plaintiffs are
unenforceable and/or that Plaintiffs’ claims have been limited, barred, or discharged
by reason of the affirmative and additional defense(s) set forth herein;
</p><p>
4. Awarding reasonable attorneys’ fees and all other recoverable expenses
to Midjourney;
</p><p>
5. Awarding Midjourney its costs; and,
</p><p>
6. Granting such other and further relief as may be just and proper.
