    <body>
Plaintiffs Disney Enterprises, Inc., Marvel Characters, Inc., MVL Film Finance
LLC, Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (collectively
“Disney”), and Universal City Studios Productions LLLP and DreamWorks Animation
L.L.C. (collectively “Universal”) bring this lawsuit for direct and secondary copyright
infringement under the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.) against Midjourney, Inc.
(“Midjourney”). This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331,
1338(a), and 17 U.S.C. § 501(b). Disney and Universal (sometimes referred to collectively
as “Plaintiffs”) allege, on personal knowledge as to themselves and information and belief
as to others, as follows:
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>
1. For more than 100 years, Disney and Universal have delighted audiences
around the world by investing in and fostering American creative innovation and producing
some of the greatest motion pictures and fictional characters of all time. Midjourney,
however, seeks to reap the rewards of Plaintiffs’ creative investment by selling an artificial
intelligence (“AI”) image-generating service (“Image Service”) that functions as a virtual
vending machine, generating endless unauthorized copies of Disney’s and Universal’s
copyrighted works.
</p><p>
2. By helping itself to Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works, and then distributing
images (and soon videos) that blatantly incorporate and copy Disney’s and Universal’s
famous characters—without investing a penny in their creation—Midjourney is the
quintessential copyright free-rider and a bottomless pit of plagiarism. Piracy is piracy, and
whether an infringing image or video is made with AI or another technology does not make
it any less infringing. Midjourney’s conduct misappropriates Disney’s and Universal’s
intellectual property and threatens to upend the bedrock incentives of U.S. copyright law
that drive American leadership in movies, television, and other creative arts.
</p><p>
3. Midjourney’s infringement is calculated and willful. Plaintiffs have asked
Midjourney to stop infringing their copyrighted works and, at a minimum, to adopt
technological measures, which other AI services have implemented to prevent the


generation of infringing material. But Midjourney, which has attracted millions of
subscribers and made $300 million last year alone, is focused on its own bottom line and
ignored Plaintiffs’ demands.
</p><p>
4. Instead, Midjourney has chosen to double down on its unlawful actions by
releasing and promoting even newer versions of its Image Service and teasing its soon-to-
be-released commercial AI video service (“Video Service”). On information and belief,
without Plaintiffs’ authorization, Midjourney’s Video Service will generate, publicly
display, and distribute videos featuring Disney’s and Universal’s copyrighted characters.
Midjourney has already begun training its Video Service, meaning that Midjourney is very
likely already infringing Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works in connection with its Video
Service.
</p><p>
5. Disney’s and Universal’s vast libraries of intellectual property include some
of the most well-known movies, television shows, and fictional characters of all time. For
Disney, these include the Star Wars franchise, the Marvel Comics properties, Pixar films,
the 20th Century Studios (formerly 20th Century Fox) library, and Disney’s namesake
animated features. Disney’s unforgettable copyrighted characters span decades of works
across a wide range of genres and tastes: Darth Vader from Star Wars, Elsa from Frozen,
Lightning McQueen from Cars, Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story, Sully from Monster’s Inc.,
Marvel’s Iron Man, and Homer Simpson from The Simpsons, to name just a few.
</p><p>
6. Universal—the oldest continuously operating movie studio in the United
States—is the home to some of the most popular and enduring animated movies and
beloved characters that have become part of modern American popular culture. These
include Shrek from the Academy Award-winning Shrek and its sequels and spin-offs, and
the Minions characters from Despicable Me and Minions movies (the highest grossing
animated franchise to date), as well as other beloved and famous characters from critically


acclaimed film franchises like Hiccup and Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon, Po
from Kung Fu Panda, and the Boss Baby from The Boss Baby.
</p><p>
7. Disney’s and Universal’s works are built on decades of financial investment,
imagination, and innovation. Few American entertainment companies have embraced
creativity and technology like Plaintiffs, from the earliest days of using technology to
synchronize sound and film, to creating virtual and immersive experiences at their world
class theme parks, to pushing the boundaries of animation through groundbreaking
rendering software, to advanced machine learning for de-aging actors in movies.
</p><p>
8. These investments of time and money are only made possible by the
incentives embodied in U.S. copyright law, which ensure copyright owners the exclusive
right to control and commercialize their own creative works. Whether it is a children’s
coloring book with Marvel superheroes, a video game based on the Shrek movies, or a
subscription service that distributes high resolution images or short videos with Plaintiffs’
copyrighted characters, only Plaintiffs are allowed to build a business around or otherwise
commercialize those characters. Midjourney’s Image Service was developed using
innumerable unauthorized copies of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works, and it operates by
reproducing, publicly displaying, making available, and distributing additional infringing
copies and derivatives of those works. If a Midjourney subscriber submits a simple text
prompt requesting an image of the character Darth Vader in a particular setting or doing a


particular action, Midjourney obliges by generating and displaying a high quality,
downloadable image featuring Disney’s copyrighted Darth Vader character:
Similarly, if a Midjourney subscriber submits a simple text prompt requesting an image of
the Minions characters in a particular setting or doing a particular action, Midjourney
obliges by generating and displaying a high quality, downloadable image featuring
Universal’s Minions:


</p><p>
9. Midjourney also copies and uses Plaintiffs’ copyrighted characters to market
and promote its Image Service, encouraging even more infringement (and falsely implying
Plaintiffs’ endorsement).
</p><p>
10. Midjourney could easily stop its theft and exploitation of Plaintiffs’
intellectual property. Midjourney controls what copyrighted content it selects, copies, and
includes in its Image Service, and it has the means to implement protection measures to
prevent the ongoing copying, public display, and distribution of Plaintiffs’ works.
Midjourney already has in place technological measures to prevent its distribution and
public display of certain images and artwork such as violence or nudity. And other AI
image- and video-generating services have instituted copyright protection measures that
recognize and protect the rights of content creators like Disney and Universal. These
readily available measures can be implemented in at least two ways: first by rejecting


prompts that request the display or download of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted characters, and
second by using technology to screen for infringing image outputs.
</p><p>
11. Before taking legal action, Plaintiffs asked Midjourney to stop its theft of their
intellectual property, including by implementing these simple measures. Instead of
stopping its infringement, Midjourney has continued to release new versions of its Image
Service, which, according to Midjourney’s founder and CEO, have even higher quality
infringing images.1 These are just a few examples of Midjourney’s latest infringement of
Plaintiffs’ copyrighted characters:
1 Jim Clyde Monge, Midjourney Finally Releases V7 Image Model, Medium (Apr. 7,
2025), https://generativeai.pub/midjourney-finally-releases-v7-image-model-
e07455e60f57.


</p><p>
12. Midjourney’s bootlegging business model and defiance of U.S copyright law
are not only an attack on Disney, Universal, and the hard-working creative community that
brings the magic of movies to life, but are also a broader threat to the American motion
picture industry which has created millions of jobs and contributed more than $260 billion
to the nation’s economy.
</p><p>
13. This case is not a “close call” under well-settled copyright law. Midjourney
set up a lucrative commercial service by making countless, unauthorized copies of
Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works, and now sells subscriptions to consumers so that they can
view and download copies and derivatives of Plaintiffs’ valuable copyrighted characters.
That is textbook copyright infringement.
</p><p>
14. Midjourney’s large-scale infringement is systematic, ongoing, and willful,
and Plaintiffs have been, and continue to be, substantially and irreparably harmed by it.
Disney and Universal bring this action to stop Midjourney’s intellectual property theft and
to uphold U.S. copyright law and the crucial incentives that reward those who create, not
those who take.

<h2>VENUE</h2>
</p><p>
27. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this Complaint pursuant to
28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1338(a), and 17 U.S.C. § 501(b).


</p><p>
28. Midjourney is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court. Midjourney is
headquartered in San Francisco, California and does continuous, systematic, and routine
business in California and in this District.
</p><p>
29. Midjourney’s unauthorized exploitation of the Copyrighted Works has caused
harm to Disney and Universal in California and in this District. Midjourney reasonably
expected or should have reasonably expected its acts to cause harm in California and in
this District because Disney Enterprises, Inc., Marvel Characters, Inc., MVL Film Finance
LLC, 20th Century Studios, Universal Pictures, and DreamWorks maintain their
headquarters in this District, and it is the location of a significant portion of Plaintiffs’
production and distribution operations.
</p><p>
30. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a
substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims have occurred in this district.
</p><p>
31. Venue is further proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1400(a)
because Midjourney is subject to personal jurisdiction in this District as it purposefully
directed its activities toward this District:
a. Midjourney knows that Disney Enterprises, Inc., Marvel Characters,
Inc., MVL Film Finance LLC, 20th Century Studios, Universal Pictures, and DreamWorks
reside in this District and has intentionally targeted Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works and
businesses by developing, training, and commercially offering its Image Service that
generates, distributes, and publicly displays infringing copies, reproductions, and
derivatives of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works. It is also common knowledge that Plaintiffs’
world-famous movie studios are located in this District. Moreover, Midjourney uses the
infringing copies of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works generated by its Image Service to
promote its Image Service and attract subscribers, including subscribers in this District.
b. Midjourney competes with Disney and Universal in this District by
distributing infringing copies, reproductions, and derivatives of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted
Works to subscribers, including subscribers in this District.


c. As recently as June 2025, Midjourney has distributed infringing copies,
reproductions, and derivatives of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works to Midjourney’s
subscribers in this District. On information and belief, during the entire relevant period,
Midjourney has distributed infringing copies, reproductions, and derivatives of Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works to subscribers in this District.
d. Midjourney offers and maintains an interactive website in this District
and purposefully directs its business activities here. Midjourney charges fees to subscribers
in this District and then makes available through downloads and/or public displays
infringing copies and derivatives of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works in this District. Further,
to purchase and use Midjourney’s Image Service, residents of this District must create an
account and provide Midjourney with their address. Midjourney accepts payment from
residents of this District to use its Image Service. Once a subscriber’s account is created
in this District, Midjourney necessarily knows that a particular user resides in this District
and therefore chooses to direct its business activities, and distribution and public display
of infringing copies of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works, into this District.
e. Midjourney has specifically targeted this District by hiring at least one
employee in Los Angeles, California which is in this District.
f. Midjourney further targets “artists” and users involved in “commercial
art project[s],” a community that includes many of the human creative professionals that
Disney and Universal have and continue to heavily invest in. In particular, Midjourney
CEO David Holz stated in a Forbes interview that Midjourney has “a famous character
designer using [its] product.” Holz further opined that the entertainment industry will use
systems like Midjourney to “try to cut costs” and that “some people will try to cut artists
out.”2 Not only do Disney and Universal each employ numerous creative professionals in

and the Creative Economy, Forbes (Sept. 16, 2022),

this District, but Los Angeles and the surrounding area is a known hub for the global
creative community. DreamWorks alone employs approximately 750 artists and 3D
animators at its Glendale campus. Midjourney’s Image Service is built off of decades of
hard work by Disney, Universal, and the broader Los Angeles creative community.
</p><p>
32. Midjourney has caused harm that was, and has been, foreseeably suffered in
this District during the relevant time period.
<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
A. Disney and Universal Have Created and Own Some of the Most Popular
Movies and Television Shows of All Time.
</p><p>
33. Disney and Universal have a long and storied history of entertaining and
inspiring audiences worldwide. Disney and Universal have created, developed, and
produced some of the most enduring, valuable, and famous copyrighted entertainment
properties in film, television, books, consumer products, theme parks, and other
experiences.
</p><p>
34. A driving force behind the success of Plaintiffs’ entertainment properties are
the imaginative and beloved copyrighted characters that appear in those Copyrighted
Works. Many of Plaintiffs’ memorable characters have become pillars of pop culture with
a lasting impact on generations of audiences and consumers.
</p><p>
35. Plaintiffs’ characters span across the numerous entertainment properties that
they own and exploit, from Princess Elsa to Buzz Lightyear, and Shrek to Minions. These
original characters are central to the entertainment properties in which they appear.
Plaintiffs’ copyright registrations for those properties encompass those characters.
</p><p>
1. The Star Wars Characters
</p><p>
36. The Star Wars franchise began in 1977 with the release of the film Episode
IV: A New Hope. The franchise is an epic space odyssey that spans multiple eras across
three sets of film trilogies, multiple standalone motion pictures and specials, numerous
live-action and animated television series, live theatrical productions, interactive video


games, novels, theme park attractions, and comic books. Disney owns the copyrights to
the Star Wars entertainment properties.
</p><p>
37. The Star Wars franchise is one of the most commercially successful franchises
in entertainment history. As of 2020, five of the Star Wars movies have each earned
over $1 billion at the global box office. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the most recent
film in the franchise, reached this mark in only 28 days.
</p><p>
38. The Star Wars franchise is built upon numerous key characters that have
expressive conceptual and physical qualities that make them distinctive and immediately
recognizable. For example, Darth Vader is the iconic villain from the original Star Wars
trilogy. Darth Vader is known for his black robes, dark powers, and signature black mask
and helmet. Yoda is the small, green, humanoid alien and Jedi Master in the Star Wars
franchise. He is old, wise, has distinctive ears, and wears a robe. The Stormtroopers are
the iconic military soldiers for the Galactic Empire and its leaders including Darth Vader.
The Stormtrooper’s distinguishable uniform consists of white armor on top of a black
underlayer and a striking white helmet. The Clone Troopers are soldiers that served as the
military for the Galactic Republic. The Clone Trooper’s distinguishable uniform typically
consists of white plates of armor over a soft black layer, and features a unique T-shaped
visor. In some portrayals, different ranks and units of Clone Troopers are denoted using
different colors of markings on their armor.
</p><p>
39. The Star Wars franchise includes several other iconic central characters like
the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, the Wookiee Chewbacca, and many more.
</p><p>
40. Disney’s copyright registrations for the entertainment properties in its Star
Wars franchise encompass the central characters therein.
</p><p>
2. The Marvel Characters
</p><p>
41. The Marvel works and characters are part of one of the largest collections of
entertainment properties that exist in the same shared universe. The origins of the Marvel
works and characters are the superheroes from comic books published by Marvel Comics.
The Marvel characters and storylines have grown considerably over time and are featured


in numerous blockbuster feature films, television series, specials, short films, books, video
games, art exhibits, theme park attractions, and, of course, comic books. Disney owns the
copyrights to these Marvel entertainment properties.
</p><p>
42. Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe, which includes films based on the
Marvel characters, is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time. All thirty-six films in
the franchise have opened number one at the domestic weekend box office.
</p><p>
43. There are numerous superheroes and other characters in the Marvel works.
These characters have expressive conceptual and physical qualities that make them
distinctive and immediately recognizable. The superhero Iron Man first appeared in
Marvel Comics in 1963, and in 2008 was featured in the blockbuster motion picture Iron
Man. Iron Man is the alter ego of eccentric billionaire businessman and engineer Tony
Stark. To transform into Iron Man, Stark dons his Iron Man suit made of distinguishable
red and gold armor that glows white over his heart and includes a red and gold mask.
</p><p>
44. The Incredible Hulk (sometimes called “The Hulk”) first appeared in Marvel
Comics in 1962. The Hulk originated when Dr. Robert Bruce Banner was accidentally
exposed to gamma rays after an experimental bomb exploded. As a result of the gamma
ray exposure, when Banner experiences emotional stress, he transforms into The Hulk, a
large, green, super muscular humanoid with extreme physical strength and anger.
</p><p>
45. Spider-Man first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1962. In the comics, high-
schooler Peter Parker became Spider-Man after he developed superhuman spider powers
from being bitten by a radioactive spider. Spider-Man wears a distinctive red and blue suit
with spider web markings and spider-based eyes.
</p><p>
46. The Marvel works include numerous other iconic central characters like
Deadpool, Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy, the X-Man Wolverine, and Captain
America. Disney’s copyright registrations for the Marvel works encompass the central
characters therein.


</p><p>
3. The Simpsons Characters
</p><p>
47. The television series The Simpsons debuted in 1989 and has become the
longest-running scripted primetime television series in American history. The series is
produced by 20th Century Studios, which was acquired by Disney approximately five years
ago. The Simpsons follows a family of five through their hijinks in the fictional town of
Springfield. In addition to the television series, The Simpsons franchise includes a movie,
comic books, video games, and books. Disney’s 20th Century Studios owns the copyrights
to the works in The Simpsons franchise.
</p><p>
48. The Simpsons franchise is built upon several key main characters. These
characters have expressive conceptual and physical qualities that make them distinctive
and immediately recognizable. Visually, characters in The Simpsons franchise are distinct
due to the animation style featured on the show. The namesake family of five consists of
Homer and Marge and their three children Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Bart Simpson, for
example, is a mischievous troublemaker who wears blue shorts and an orange-red shirt and
has signature spiked hair. The father, Homer Simpson, is a loveable goof with a penchant
for donuts, wears blue pants with a white top, and has two signature strands of hair.
</p><p>
49. Disney’s copyright registrations for the entertainment properties in The
Simpsons franchise encompass the central characters therein.
</p><p>
4. The Pixar Works and Characters
</p><p>
50. Pixar is an animation studio that has produced dozens of critically acclaimed
and commercially successful computer-animated films. In 1995, Pixar released Toy Story,
which became an overnight sensation and box office success, grossing over $350 million
worldwide. Since then, the Pixar works have expanded to include several highly successful
motion picture franchises and standalone films including Monsters, Inc., Cars, and The
Incredibles. Additionally, the characters from the Pixar works appear in several theme
park attractions, experiences, and consumer products. Disney owns the copyrights to the
Pixar entertainment properties.


</p><p>
51. The Pixar entertainment properties have achieved both commercial and
critical success. Eight of Pixar’s films have surpassed the $1 billion mark at the worldwide
box office, something only eleven animated films have ever done. In addition, Pixar’s
films have won eighteen Academy Awards and received forty-nine nominations.
</p><p>
52. The Pixar works feature numerous, highly expressive copyrighted characters
adored by fans. Buzz Lightyear, for example, is a central character in the Toy Story
franchise. He is a superhero action figure that wears a green and white spacesuit with a
clear dome-shaped helmet and expandable wings. Lightning McQueen is an
anthropomorphic stock car and the main character in the Cars franchise. He is a red race
car with a yellow lightning bolt on his sides along with the number 95.
</p><p>
53. Disney’s copyright registrations for the Pixar entertainment properties
encompass the central characters therein.
</p><p>
5. Disney Classic Animation Characters
</p><p>
54. Animated cartoons have been a bedrock in Disney’s intellectual property
portfolio since the 1920s. Disney’s classic animation characters have delighted and
entertained generations of audiences.
</p><p>
55. In 1937, Disney released its first animated feature film, Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs. The movie became the highest-grossing film of all time until it was
surpassed by Gone with the Wind. Since the release of Snow White, Disney has released
numerous successful animated feature films such as Peter Pan, The Little Mermaid, The
Lion King, Frozen, and Mulan. Disney holds the copyrights to each of these feature films
along with several sequels, television series, short films, books, and other works in these
franchises and Disney’s classic animation universe.

beloved characters including Princess Elsa and Olaf from Frozen, Ariel from The Little
Mermaid, Jasmine and Aladdin from Aladdin, Mulan from Mulan, Lilo and Stitch from
Lilo & Stitch, and Snow White from Snow White.


</p><p>
57. The iconic central characters in Disney’s classic animation properties have

recognizable. Elsa, for one, is a princess with the ability to control ice and snow, who
wears a glittering blue dress and has flowing, light blond hair. Stitch, for another, is a
mischievous blue extraterrestrial with large floppy ears, a round black nose, and black eyes.
</p><p>
58. Disney’s copyright registrations for its classic animation entertainment
properties encompass the central characters therein.
</p><p>
6. Universal Pictures’ Minions Characters
</p><p>
59. The Despicable Me franchise began in 2010 with Universal Pictures’ release
of the original Despicable Me film. The Despicable Me franchise is not only the highest-
grossing animated film franchise of all time, but it is also among the highest-grossing of
any film franchises of all time, having grossed over $5 billion since 2010. The Despicable
Me franchise has spawned four main feature films, a Minions three-film prequel series, 20
short films, a holiday television special, a Saturday Morning Minions digital series
consisting of forty episodes, several video games, and theme park attractions in Universal
Studios Hollywood, located in this District, as well as theme parks in Florida and
throughout Asia.
</p><p>
60. The Despicable Me franchise is built upon numerous key characters that have
expressive conceptual and physical qualities that make them distinctive and immediately
recognizable. One of the most ubiquitous and recognizable characters from the franchise
is the Minion. Minions were first introduced in Despicable Me as members of the army of
the film’s antagonist, Felonious Gru, but quickly achieved fame on their own, and
eventually became the main characters in the Minions spin-off film series.
</p><p>
61. Minions are instantly recognizable due to their distinctive capsule shape and
yellow color. Minions have one or two brown eyes, sparse black or no hair, and lack visible
noses and ears. Minions wear black gloves and metal goggles, and often wear denim
overalls that sometimes feature Gru’s logo on the pocket.


</p><p>
62. Universal Pictures’ copyright registrations for the Despicable Me franchise
encompass the central characters therein, including the Minions.
</p><p>
7. DreamWorks Characters
</p><p>
63. Universal’s DreamWorks animation studio has released 50 films and over 50
television series in its 30 years, making it one of the largest animation production
companies in the world. DreamWorks films and television shows are critically acclaimed,
and have received Academy Awards, Emmy Awards, and Golden Globe Awards.
DreamWorks has also received awards for being an industry leader in technological
innovations.
</p><p>
64. The Shrek franchise is among DreamWorks’ most successful ventures.
DreamWorks has released four Shrek feature films, with Shrek 5 slated for release next
year. The Shrek franchise also consists of short films, theme park attractions, television
specials, video games, comic books, spin-off films based on the Puss in Boots character,
and a Broadway musical. Shrek is the second highest-grossing animated film franchise of
all time, after Universal’s Despicable Me.
</p><p>
65. Shrek’s namesake character is a large, bald, dull-green ogre with a broad,
round face, brown eyes, and highly distinctive trumpet-shaped ears. Shrek typically wears
crude clothing consisting of a canvas-like shirt, a leather vest, and brown leggings.
</p><p>
66. The How to Train Your Dragon franchise began with the release of the first
of three animated films, How to Train Your Dragon, in 2010. Since 2010, the franchise
has grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide, and has received overwhelmingly positive critical
reviews. The How to Train Your Dragon franchise has won Golden Globe Awards and
been nominated for Academy Awards. In addition to the three original animated films,
Universal plans to release a live-action remake of How to Train Your Dragon on June 16,
2025, with a How to Train Your Dragon 2 remake expected in 2027. The franchise also
consists of the DreamWorks Dragons television series, short films, video games, comic
books and graphic novels, live performance adaptations, and theme park attractions.


</p><p>
67. The How to Train Your Dragon franchise is built upon several key main
characters. These characters have expressive conceptual and physical qualities that make
them distinctive and immediately recognizable. The protagonist of the franchise, Hiccup
Horrendous Haddock III, or “Hiccup,” is a scrawny, teenage Viking boy, with medium-
length tousled hair and green eyes. Hiccup often wears armor made of dark brown leather.
Toothless is the dragon who belongs to Hiccup in the franchise. Toothless has a sleek body
covered in matte, jet-black scales, with bat-like wings and a long tail. He is a medium-
sized, aerodynamic dragon, with pointy black ears that are pointed backwards. Toothless
has a short, rounded muzzle, with large, cat-like green eyes.
</p><p>
68. The Kung Fu Panda franchise began with DreamWorks’ release of the 2008
animated film of the same name. The original Kung Fu Panda had the highest-grossing
opening for any DreamWorks non-sequel film; other than Shrek, its domestic box office
revenue was also the highest of all non-sequel DreamWorks films until How to Train Your
Dragon was released in 2010. Today, the Kung Fu Panda franchise extends to video
games, an interactive theme park experience, a live show, short films, and television series.
</p><p>
69. The franchise follows a giant animated panda, Po Ping, or “Po,” as he is
chosen to be the legendary Dragon Warrior and seeks to become a Kung Fu master. Po is
depicted as a rotund, animated panda, who initially struggles to become proficient in Kung
Fu but ultimately grows into his own unique fighting style motivated by his love of food,
and leans into his bulky physique to become a skilled martial artist.
</p><p>
70. Po is portrayed as a chubby, anthropomorphic panda with a white face, black
ears, and black fur around his eyes. Po’s upper body and arms are covered with black fur,
while his torso is covered with white fur. Po wears brown burlap pants that have a
waistband of vertical dark red and yellow stripes. Po also wears shoes that are intended to
look like panda toes.
</p><p>
71. The Boss Baby film franchise began with the 2017 animated film of the same
name. The franchise also includes two television series, two short films, and an interactive
special. The franchise has been praised for its adult humor despite being in an animation


format and was nominated for Academy and Golden Globe Awards. The Boss Baby earned
over $500 million at the box office worldwide.
</p><p>
72. The Boss Baby’s titular character, “Boss Baby,” also known as “Theodore
Templeton Jr.” or simply “Ted,” is an infant who speaks and carries himself like an adult
when parents and adults are not around. Ted is visually distinct and deliberately designed
to contrast the cuteness of a baby with the seriousness of a corporate executive. Ted has an
oversized, round baby head with a high forehead, green eyes and blonde hair that forms a
widow’s peak. Ted is usually portrayed wearing a full suit, or just a diaper.
</p><p>
73. Universal’s copyright registrations for its DreamWorks entertainment
properties encompass the central characters therein.
B. Midjourney Infringes Plaintiffs’ Intellectual Property
</p><p>
1. Midjourney’s Image Service
</p><p>
74. Midjourney was founded in 2021 by David Holz, its Chief Executive Officer.
Midjourney develops, operates, and sells its generative AI services, including its Image
Service. Midjourney is a successful enterprise that surpassed $200 million in revenue in
2023, and reportedly made $300 million in revenue in 2024, despite the company’s
relatively short existence. Midjourney had nearly 21 million users as of September 2024.3
</p><p>
75. Unbeknownst to Plaintiffs, Midjourney first launched its Image Service in
February 2022 as a “bot” accessible within the Discord communication platform. Since
then, Midjourney has released various versions of its Image Service. Midjourney began to
offer its Image Service to consumers via its own website, Midjourney.com, in or around
October 2023. Originally, the website was open only to Midjourney customers who had
used Midjourney’s Image Service via the Discord platform. On or around August 23, 2024,
3 See Kyle Wiggers, Midjourney Says It’s ‘Getting Into Hardware’, TechCrunch (Aug. 28,
2024), https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/midjourney-says-its-getting-into-hardware/;
Naveen Kumar, Midjourney Statistics 2025: Users & Revenue Data, DemandSage (Dec.
31, 2024), https://www.demandsage.com/midjourney-statistics/; Oskar Mortensen, How
Many People Work at Midjourney? Statistics & Facts (2025), SEO.AI (Dec. 2, 2024).


Midjourney began offering its Image Service to all subscribers. On or around April 3,
2025, Midjourney launched version 7 (“V7”) of its Image Service. Midjourney’s Image
Service is a commercial service. Currently, subscribers can access the Image Service by
signing up for a subscription on Midjourney’s website.4 Midjourney offers four different
subscription levels, as shown below:
4 See https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/plans.


</p><p>
76. Midjourney’s four levels of paid subscriptions range from $10 per month to
$120 per month. Subscribers can receive a discount of approximately 20% on monthly
pricing by paying for an annual subscription. Image generation requires processing time
on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and Midjourney’s different subscription levels
come with different amounts of “Fast” GPU time. According to Midjourney, it takes them
approximately one minute of GPU time to generate, reproduce, and publicly display
(and/or distribute) further copies of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
77. What Midjourney calls its “Basic Plan” costs $10 per month and comes with
</p><p>
3.3 hours of Fast GPU Time per month. This allows Basic Plan subscribers to receive
roughly 200 images per month. The more expensive the plan, the more Fast GPU Time
the subscriber is allocated, and the more images that subscriber can receive. All subscribers
can purchase additional Fast GPU Time for $4 per hour.
</p><p>
78. Additionally, subscribers with a “Standard Plan,” “Pro Plan,” or “Mega Plan”
receive unlimited “Relax” GPU Time. An image generated using Relax GPU Time, which
Midjourney refers to as “Relax Mode,” does not cost the subscriber any Fast GPU Time,
however, the generation is placed into a queue based on how much the subscriber has used
the system. Wait times in Relax Mode can range up to ten minutes per job.
</p><p>
79. Copies of the images generated by Midjourney for its subscribers are also
publicly displayed on the “Explore” page on Midjourney’s website. Midjourney’s Explore
page is a prominent feature of its website where Midjourney advertises the images that its
Images Service has generated. The Explore page is a means for Midjourney to promote its
Image Service, attract subscribers to the Image Service, and encourage them to use the
Image Service, thereby generating more money for Midjourney.
</p><p>
2. Midjourney Reproduces, Generates, Publicly Displays, and
Distributes Reproductions and Derivative Works of Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
80. Through its own affirmative conduct, including the selection of which
Copyrighted Works will be stored by and made available through the Image Service,


Midjourney directly reproduces, publicly displays, and distributes reproductions and
derivative works of Disney and Universal content.
</p><p>
81. The examples below confirm that Midjourney directly produces image
outputs that infringe on Plaintiffs’ copyrighted characters.

displayed, and made available for download an image output that copies Universal’s Po
character from the Kung Fu Panda franchise, as shown in this screenshot:
Midjourney Output Universal’s Copyrighted Character(s)
</p><p>
113. As explained below, Midjourney is able to reproduce, publicly display, and
distribute these copies because Midjourney selected and copied Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted
Works as part of the training process for its Image Service.
</p><p>
3. Midjourney Was Trained to Output Infringing Content
</p><p>
114. The fact that Midjourney generates copies and derivatives of Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works demonstrates that Midjourney, without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or


permission, copied Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works to train and develop its Image Service.
It also shows that Midjourney’s AI Image Service, through software programming and
computer storage devices, embodies “copies” of those works, as that term is defined in
Section 101 of the Copyright Act, in the AI software that powers the Image Service. On
information and belief, and unbeknownst to Disney and Universal, Midjourney developed
and trained its Image Service on copyrighted works, including Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted
Works to help ensure that it is able to reproduce, publicly display, and distribute faithful,
high-quality copies and derivative works of the works it trained on, including Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
115. Based on the facts and circumstantial evidence alleged in this Complaint and
common knowledge about the process for creating a generative AI image service like
Midjourney, Plaintiffs are informed and believe that Midjourney engaged in the following
conduct to train its Image Service:
a. First, Midjourney gathered the underlying works to be used to train the
service. To do so, Midjourney downloaded from the internet, and other sources, content
using tools variously described as bots, scrapers, streamrippers, video downloaders, and
web crawlers. David Holz admitted that to collect the training data, Midjourney “pulls off
all the data it can, all the text it can, all the images it can.”5 Mr. Holz elaborated saying
that Midjourney, “grabs everything they can, they dump it in a huge file, and they kind of
set it on fire to train some huge thing.” Admitting even more, in a September 2022
interview, Mr. Holz confirmed that Midjourney never sought any copyright content
5 James Vincent, ‘An Engine for the Imagination’: The Rise of AI Image Generators, An
Interview with Midjourney Founder David Holz, The Verge (Aug. 2, 2022),

multiverse-interview-david-holz.


holders’ consent to copy and exploit their works.6 The data gathered and copied by
Midjourney to use in training its Image Service includes Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works.
b. Second, to prepare the data for ingestion, Midjourney “cleaned” the
copies of the underlying works that were collected in the previous step through a filtering
process and reformatted (e.g., converted them to a common technical format) the copies
that were not filtered out in the cleaning process to train its Image Service. This step
necessarily included creating more copies of the materials obtained in the gathering phase,
such as a new copy of each reformatted item (including Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works).
c. Third, Midjourney then used the collected and cleaned data and
Copyrighted Works to “train” its Image Service. Although the specifics of this training
phase have not been disclosed by Midjourney, and will be the subject of discovery in this
action, Midjourney’s ability to repeatedly access the data stored in its software system and
reproduce, publicly display, and distribute further copies of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works
for its subscribers demonstrates that Midjourney’s training of its generative AI model
involved the fixation of copies of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works in a tangible medium from
which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated with the aid of
a machine or device. Midjourney’s process of training and making multiple copies of
Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works was done without Plaintiffs’ approval or authorization.
</p><p>
116. In other words, Midjourney used software, servers, and other technology to
store and fix data associated with Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works in such a manner that
those works are thereby embodied in the model, from which Midjourney is then able to
generate, reproduce, publicly display, and distribute unlimited “copies” of Plaintiffs’ works
as defined by the Copyright Act.

and the Creative Economy, Forbes (Sept. 16, 2022),

on-the-impact-of-ai-on-art-imagination-and-the-creative-economy/.


</p><p>
117. Moreover, Midjourney repeats this process each time it trains and creates a
substantially new version of its Image Service. With each major reiteration of its Image
Service, Midjourney created a new model trained anew on Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works
without Plaintiffs’ knowledge. For example, according to Midjourney’s CEO, version 6
of Midjourney was actually the “third model trained from scratch.”
</p><p>
118. To be clear, Midjourney had to copy Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works in order
for it to be able to subsequently disseminate reproductions and derivatives of Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works as outputs. Midjourney’s unauthorized copying of Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works to train its Image Service infringes Plaintiffs’ copyrights in their
Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
4. Midjourney’s Public Display and Distribution of Disney’s and
Universal’s Copyrighted Works Is Pervasive.
</p><p>
119. Once the training process is complete, due to Midjourney’s massive copying
of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works, and as a direct and intentional result of Midjourney’s
development and training, Midjourney’s Image Service generates reproductions and
derivatives of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works. Midjourney is able, by its Image Service, to
further reproduce, publicly display, and distribute image outputs that are identical or
virtually identical to Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works in response to simple text-based
prompts from subscribers.
</p><p>
120. As repeatedly shown above, the outputs created by Midjourney are copies and
derivative works of Disney’s and Universal’s valuable copyrighted characters. When a
subscriber enters a prompt for an image of Spider-Man, Minions, Iron Man, or any of
Plaintiffs’ countless copyrighted characters, Midjourney creates yet another copy of that
character which it publicly displays and/or distributes via download. These so-called
outputs are copies and/or derivatives of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted characters. Midjourney
thus has an endless supply of copies and derivative works that it can publicly display and
distribute to subscribers on demand.


</p><p>
121. Indeed, in true vending machine form, Midjourney distributes and displays
copy after copy after copy of Plaintiffs’ iconic copyrighted characters to its subscribers and
on its website as part of its Explore feature. These copies often contain extensive infringing
nuance and detail, background elements, costumes, and accessories beyond what was
specified in the prompt.
</p><p>
122. By publicly displaying, reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative
works of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works, as described above, Midjourney has directly
infringed (and continues to directly infringe) Plaintiffs’ exclusive rights as copyright
holders, including the rights of reproduction, distribution, public display, and preparation
of derivative works.
</p><p>
123. Midjourney has faced widespread criticism for copying, publicly displaying,
and distributing images of copyrighted works, including images of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted
Works. AI researcher Gary Marcus and film artist Reid Southen published a research
article detailing how Midjourney generates copyrighted works.7 As shown in the images
from their article displayed on the next page, Midjourney version 6.0 generated images that
were copies of stills from Disney’s movie Avengers: Infinity War:
7 Gary Marcus and Reid Southen, Generative AI Has A Visual Plagiarism Problem
Experiments With Midjourney And DALL-E 3 Show A Copyright Minefield, IEEE
Spectrum (Jan. 6, 2024), https://spectrum.ieee.org/midjourney-copyright.




</p><p>
124. Further, Dr. Marcus and Mr. Southen noted that Midjourney generated images
that infringed Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works even when the prompt did not ask Midjourney
for Plaintiffs’ specific characters. As stated in the research paper, in response to Dr. Marcus
and Mr. Southen’s prompt “yellow 3d cartoon character with goggles and overalls --v 6.0
--ar 16:9” Midjourney accessed the data about Universal’s Copyrighted Works that is
stored by the Image Service and then generated the following output that copies Universal’s
Minions characters from the Despicable Me franchise:


</p><p>
125. Dr. Marcus and Mr. Southen also used Midjourney to create images of
characters from Disney’s The Simpsons by using the prompt “popular 90’s animated
cartoon with yellow skin --v 6.0 --ar 16:9 --style raw,” which notably did not expressly
request The Simpsons characters, as shown in the image below:


</p><p>
126. Dr. Marcus and Mr. Southen detailed numerous prompts in response to which
Midjourney generated outputs featuring Disney’s and Universal’s Copyrighted Works
even when the prompt did not expressly request Copyrighted Works. In response to Dr.
Marcus and Mr. Southen’s prompt “black armor with light sword, movie screencap -- ar
16:9 --v 6.0 -- style raw,” Midjourney accessed the data about Disney’s Copyrighted Works
that is stored by the Image Service and then generated the following output that copies
Disney’s Darth Vader and The Mandalorian characters:


</p><p>
127. In response to Dr. Marcus and Mr. Southen’s single word prompt “screencap,”
Midjourney accessed the data about Disney’s Copyrighted Works that is stored by the
Image Service and then generated the following output that copies Disney’s Spider-Man
and Loki characters from its Marvel franchises, and Elsa from Frozen:


</p><p>
128. In response to Dr. Marcus and Mr. Southen’s prompt “popular movie
screencap --ar 1:1 --v 6.0,” Midjourney accessed the data about Disney’s Copyrighted
Works that is stored by the Image Service and then generated the following output that
copies Disney’s Iron Man character:


</p><p>
129. In response to Dr. Marcus and Mr. Southen’s prompt “animated toys --v 6.0 -
-ar 16:9 --style raw,” Midjourney accessed the data about Disney’s Copyrighted Works
that is stored by the Image Service and then generated the following output that copies
Disney’s characters from the Toy Story franchise:


</p><p>
130. In response to Dr. Marcus and Mr. Southen’s prompt “protocol droid from
classic sci-fi movie --v 6.0 --ar 16:9,” Midjourney accessed the data about Disney’s
Copyrighted Works that is stored by the Image Service and then generated the following
output that copies Disney’s Star Wars droids R2-D2 and C-3PO:


</p><p>
131. In response to Dr. Marcus and Mr. Southen’s prompt “man in robes with light
sword, movie screen cap --ar 16:9 --v 6.0 --style raw,” Midjourney accessed the data about
Disney’s Copyrighted Works that is stored by the Image Service and then generated the
following output that copies Disney’s Luke Skywalker character:
</p><p>
132. Other prominent publications have reported on Midjourney’s ability to
generate images that infringe copyrighted content.
</p><p>
5. Midjourney’s Infringement of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works Is a
Feature of Its Image Service and a Draw to Consumers.
</p><p>
133. Midjourney has already generated countless images that infringe on Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works and publicly displayed and/or distributed innumerable copies of each
of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted characters to Midjourney subscribers. Midjourney also publicly
displays copies of Plaintiffs’ characters on the “Explore” page on its website which is
accessible to subscribers and non-subscribers alike. There, as an added service to
subscribers, Midjourney subscribers can search the various images previously generated


by Midjourney for other subscribers. As shown below, this Explore page contains a
seemingly limitless trove of infringing copies of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works, and
showcases how subscribers are drawn to the Image Service because of the availability of
Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works. On information and belief, Midjourney curates and
presents Explore page search results that publicly display images that infringe Plaintiffs’
copyrighted characters. Midjourney’s publication and curation of infringing images on the
Explore page show that Midjourney knows that its platform regularly reproduces Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works, and that the Explore page is intended to advertise Midjourney’s ability
to infringe the Copyrighted Works.

</p><p>
165. When the Explore page is searched for “Kung Fu Panda,” Midjourney
publicly displays the infringing images of Universal’s Po character that Midjourney has
generated and distributed to its subscribers:
</p><p>
166. By maintaining and publicly displaying infringing copies of Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works on its Explore page, Midjourney is advertising its ability to reliably
reproduce Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works for its subscribers. Midjourney’s Explore gallery
also demonstrates that Midjourney subscribers use Midjourney to view and/or download
copies of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
167. Midjourney’s Explore page manifests its express intention and desire to attract
Midjourney subscribers (and increase its revenues) by exploiting the availability of
infringing Plaintiffs’ content and its ability to reliably reproduce Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted
Works for its subscribers. And Midjourney further facilitates and encourages infringement
by publicly displaying the prompts used to generate the images Midjourney displays on the
Explore page which encourages Midjourney subscribers to obtain similar results to those
they find in the gallery.


</p><p>
168. Midjourney’s Explore page further evidences Midjourney’s knowledge that
its Image Service both generates images that infringe Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works, and
that it uses these images to attract subscribers who wish to use the Image Service for the
express purpose of reproducing Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works. Midjourney curates and
presents Explore page search results that publicly display images that infringe Plaintiffs’
copyrighted characters. This curation demonstrates Midjourney’s specific knowledge that
its Image Service reliably reproduces Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works, and shows that the
reproductions are extremely high quality.
</p><p>
169. Midjourney’s infringement of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works is a well-
documented “feature” of its Image Service. Several websites, Reddit threads, and online
posts confirm that Midjourney subscribers are drawn to Midjourney due to its ability to
infringe Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works.8

from this fine collection,” and the “OP” (shorthand for “original poster”) replied with one
of the prompts they had used, suggesting that users are drawn to Midjourney because it
accepts infringing prompts and successfully and repeatedly generates infringing images.

177. Another Reddit user posted an image of “Darth Vader” in the r/Midjourney

</p><p>
180. Additionally, in an article on the popular website Medium titled “Recreating
Classic Disney 1930s Style Animation with Midjourney AI,” user InstantAI provided
sample prompts for Midjourney to generate copies of Disney’s Copyrighted Works,
including Snow White. In response to one of these prompts, Midjourney accessed the data
about Disney’s Copyrighted Works that is stored by the Image Service and then generated
the following image which infringes Disney’s Snow White character:

rations_prompt_in/#lightbox.


</p><p>
181. As further evidence that users are drawn to Midjourney’s Image Service
because it distributes infringing copies of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted characters, there are now
marketplaces and forums where users exchange tips about how to use the service to
download a variety of images featuring Plaintiffs’ copyrighted characters. These
marketplaces and forums, as well as the articles, social media, and other postings discussed
above, demonstrate as strong public desire to use Midjourney’s commercial Image Service
as a source for reproductions of characters from Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
6. Midjourney Chooses to Not Take Any Reasonable Measures to
Prevent Further Copyright Infringement.
</p><p>
182. Midjourney could stop, or at least minimize, its ongoing copyright
infringement. Specifically, in addition to discontinuing its large-scale infringement of the
Copyrighted Works to train its models, Midjourney could readily implement copyright
protection measures to prevent or limit infringing outputs.


</p><p>
183. Midjourney already uses technical measures to prevent the generation of
certain content. For example, if a Midjourney subscriber submits a prompt asking for
images with violence or nudity, Midjourney’s protection measures cause a response that
says “Sorry! The AI Moderator is unsure about this prompt. It might not meet our
community guidelines or our AI moderation might have gotten confused. Please try a
different one.” An example of this is shown below:
</p><p>
184. The error messages explain Midjourney’s “Community Standards,” which list
four categories of prompts that Midjourney does not allow: (1) “Content that disrespects,
harms, or misleads about public figures or events,” (2) “Hate speech, explicit or real-world
violence,” (3) “Nudity or overtly sexualized images,” and (4) “Imagery that might be
considered culturally insensitive.”
</p><p>
185. Midjourney’s Terms of Service further describe its prohibitions on “adult
content,” “gore,” and “images for political campaigns,” and ask subscribers to “avoid
making visually shocking or disturbing content.” The Terms of Service then explain that
Midjourney “will block some text inputs automatically.”
</p><p>
186. This demonstrates that Midjourney controls, and has the ability to control,
generative outputs through readily available technical protection measures. Despite having
the ability to do so, Midjourney has affirmatively chosen not to use copyright protection
measures to limit the infringement of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works before or after
receiving Plaintiffs’ cease-and-desist letters.
</p><p>
187. In contrast, other AI services have demonstrated that reasonable, readily
available copyright protection measures can prevent or limit infringing generative AI


outputs, including by screening image outputs for infringing material before the image is
displayed to the subscriber, and by refusing to allow generations based on prompts likely
to elicit infringing content.
</p><p>
188. Midjourney also makes clear in its Terms of Service that it has the ability to
police and control the content its service makes available, stating that it can terminate
“access to and use of” the Image Service “for any user who engages in repeated acts of
[copyright] infringement.”18 However, given the extraordinary volume of outputs that
infringe Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works, it is evident that this provision of the Terms of
Service is merely Midjourney paying lip service to put up a façade that its Image Service
complies with copyright law.
</p><p>
189. Midjourney’s infringement of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works is manifestly
willful. Counsel for Plaintiffs sent Midjourney letters detailing Midjourney’s extensive
infringement of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works, attached as Exhibits C and D. In its letter,
Disney put Midjourney on notice that its Image Service was generating images of Disney’s
iconic characters including The Simpsons, Spider-Man, several Guardians of the Galaxy
characters including Groot, Drax the Destroyer, and Rocket, the Star Wars droids R2-D2
and C-3PO, Stormtroopers, and Buzz Lightyear. Similarly, Universal put Midjourney on
notice that its Image Service was generating images of its iconic characters including
Shrek, Hiccup and Toothless from the How to Train Your Dragon film franchise, Boss
Baby, Po from Kung Fu Panda, and the Minions from the Despicable Me and Minions film
franchises.
</p><p>
190. On December 11, 2024, Midjourney informed counsel for Disney that it was
reviewing Disney’s letter. Apart from that brief communication, Midjourney never
responded to Disney’s letter. Midjourney never responded to Universal’s letter at all.
Despite being put on notice of its infringement of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works,
18 See Terms of Service, Midjourney (Feb. 5, 2025), available at
https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32083055291277-Terms-of-Service.


Midjourney has not implemented any reasonable technical measures or otherwise
attempted to cease its infringement or purge its Explore page of the numerous images
infringing Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works. Notably, the infringing images shown above
include images that were reproduced, publicly displayed, and distributed by Midjourney
after Plaintiffs sent their cease-and-desist letters to Midjourney.
</p><p>
191. Far from working with Plaintiffs to address the concerns raised in their letters,
Midjourney doubled down on its infringement. On April 3, 2025, Midjourney released a
new and improved version of its Image Service dubbed “V7.” The ability to infringe
Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works remains a central feature of V6 and V7 of Midjourney’s
Image Service which are both in use. And just a few days ago, Midjourney’s CEO publicly
announced Midjourney’s continued focus on improving V7, while continuing to make V6
available, and touted Midjourney’s soon-to-be-released video service, noting it works well
with images from Midjourney.
</p><p>
192. If Midjourney is not enjoined, it intends to continue to develop and scale its
Image Service and thereby enhance its ability to infringe Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works.
Indeed, last week, Midjourney’s CEO announced that Midjourney plans to continue
deploying new versions its Image Service and to launch its Video Service sometime this
month.
</p><p>
193. Based on the facts alleged in this Complaint, Plaintiffs are informed and
believe that Midjourney’s forthcoming Video Service will allow paying subscribers to
request copies of videos featuring Plaintiffs’ copyrighted characters and incorporating
Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works, and will reproduce, publicly perform, and distribute videos
containing and infringing Plaintiffs’ characters.
</p><p>
194. Given that Midjourney’s Image Service was trained on Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works without authorization and unbeknownst to Plaintiffs, it is likely that
Midjourney is currently training its forthcoming Video Service on Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted
Works.


</p><p>
195. Midjourney’s planned Video Service would only enhance Midjourney’s
ability to distribute infringing copies, reproductions, and derivatives of Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
196. Midjourney’s unlawful conduct has caused, and will continue to cause,
substantial and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs if it is not enjoined.
</p><p>
197. Plaintiffs exercise their exclusive rights to exploit and license (or not to
license) its characters and intellectual property to develop and grow selected markets for
their Copyrighted Works. Midjourney’s conduct usurps Plaintiffs’ control over the
exercise of their exclusive rights in their Copyrighted Works, interfering with Plaintiffs’
exploitation and licensing strategies.
</p><p>
198. Midjourney illegally and unfairly competes with companies that license
Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works for the purpose of creating authorized derivatives, and
undercuts those existing and potential licensing markets. Such companies negotiate
licenses with Plaintiffs and abide by contractual restrictions in those agreements.
Midjourney need not honor such contractual restrictions because it circumvents the
licensing process altogether.
</p><p>
199. Midjourney is also contributing to consumer confusion regarding what is
lawful and what is not lawful by misleading its subscribers to believe that Midjourney’s
massive copying and the countless infringing images generated by its Image Service are
somehow authorized by Plaintiffs.
</p><p>
200. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the substantial and irreparable
harm that Midjourney has caused and continues to cause. Midjourney must be held
accountable for its vast, intentional, and unrelenting copyright infringement and enjoined
from further infringing activities.
<h2>RELIEF</h2>
(Direct Copyright Infringement)
</p><p>
201. Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference each and every averment contained
in paragraphs 1 to 200 inclusive.


</p><p>
202. Plaintiffs own the Copyrighted Works at issue, including those in the non-
exhaustive, representative lists attached as Exhibits A and B, and have the exclusive right,
among others, to reproduce, publicly display, distribute, and make derivative works under
Section 106 of the Copyright Act.
</p><p>
203. Plaintiffs never authorized Midjourney to reproduce, publicly display,
distribute, make derivatives of, or otherwise exploit their Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
204. Midjourney has directly infringed Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works by
unlawfully reproducing, publicly displaying, distributing, and making derivative works
based on Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works both in developing and training its Image Service
and in the output Midjourney generates for its subscribers.
</p><p>
205. Each act of infringement by Midjourney constitutes a separate and distinct act
of infringement.
</p><p>
206. Midjourney’s acts of infringement are willful, in disregard of and with
indifference to Plaintiffs’ rights.
</p><p>
207. Midjourney is purposefully exploiting Plaintiffs’ valuable intellectual
property to attract subscribers, and profiting by providing subscribers with countless copies
and derivatives of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
208. As a direct and proximate result of Midjourney’s infringement, Plaintiffs are
entitled to damages and Midjourney’s profits in an amount according to proof.
</p><p>
209. Alternatively, and at their election, Plaintiffs are entitled to statutory damages,
up to $150,000 per infringed work by virtue of Midjourney’s willful infringement, or for
such other amounts as may be proper under 17 U.S.C. § 504.
</p><p>
210. Plaintiffs are further entitled to recover their attorneys’ fees and full costs
pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 505.
</p><p>
211. As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts and conduct, Plaintiffs
have sustained and will continue to sustain substantial and irreparable injury, for which
there is no adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined and restrained by this Court,


Midjourney will continue to infringe Plaintiffs’ rights in their Copyrighted Works.
Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief under 17 U.S.C. § 502.
<h2>RELIEF</h2>
(Secondary Copyright Infringement)
</p><p>
212. Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference each and every averment contained
in paragraphs 1 to 200 inclusive.
</p><p>
213. Plaintiffs allege that Midjourney is the direct copyright infringer of the
Copyrighted Works at issue in this litigation. However, in the event that Midjourney
argues that it is not the direct infringer of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works, and that its own
subscribers are somehow the direct infringers of the Copyrighted Works, then Plaintiffs
plead, in the alternative, that Midjourney is nevertheless liable for secondary copyright
infringement.
</p><p>
214. Plaintiffs own the Copyrighted Works at issue, including those in the non-
exhaustive, representative lists attached as Exhibit A and B, and have the exclusive right,
among others, to reproduce, publicly display, distribute, and make derivative works under
Section 106 of the Copyright Act.
</p><p>
215. As alleged above, the unauthorized reproduction, public display, distribution,
and creation of derivatives of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works through Midjourney’s output
infringes Plaintiffs’ exclusive copyrights under Section 106 of the Copyright Act.
</p><p>
216. If Midjourney contends that its own subscribers are the volitional actors
responsible for making the copies of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works identified in this
Complaint, such copying was done (and is being done) without Plaintiffs’ authorization or
consent and constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act.
</p><p>
217. Midjourney is vicariously liable for these acts of direct copyright infringement
(assuming they are adjudicated to be direct infringement by Midjourney’s subscribers).
</p><p>
218. Midjourney has the right and ability to supervise and/or control these acts of
direct copyright infringement.


</p><p>
219. First, Midjourney has the ability to control the copyright infringement at issue
because Midjourney controls and selects which of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works are
copied and used to train its Image Service. Midjourney had the right and ability to exclude
Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works from its training data.
</p><p>
220. Second, Midjourney has the right and ability to control the prompts from its
subscribers that are submitted to its Image Service to generate an output and the ability to
block subscribers who request infringing content.
</p><p>
221. Third, Midjourney has protection measures already in place that expressly
block the generation of certain content (e.g., disrespectful images of public figures, hate
speech, violence, nudity, and culturally insensitive information). Midjourney, however,
has not implemented those measures to limit its Image Service from infringing Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works. This is the case even though such copyright protection measures are
employed by a number of Midjourney’s competitors.
</p><p>
222. As evidenced by the Explore pages featuring Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works,
and subscribers’ interest in using the Image Service to produce infringing copies of
Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works, the ability to use the Image Service to obtain copies of
Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works is plainly an attraction and a draw for subscribers.
</p><p>
223. At all relevant times, Midjourney has derived a direct financial benefit from
each act of direct infringement at issue. Midjourney is a commercial service as Midjourney
subscribers must pay to access the Image Service. Thus, Midjourney receives revenue
from all of its subscribers. By providing more generations and features to subscribers with
more expensive plans, Midjourney encourages its subscribers to pay more for its service.
Moreover, Midjourney surpassed $200 million in revenue in 2023, and hit $300 million in
revenue in 2024, despite the company’s relatively short existence. Midjourney reportedly
had nearly 21 million subscribers as of September 2024. Midjourney’s popularity and
economic success is directly tied to the popularity of its Image Service and its ability to
reproduce, publicly display, and create derivatives of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works.


</p><p>
224. Midjourney is also secondarily liable for copyright infringement as a
contributory infringer (if Midjourney contends that its subscribers are the ones making the
infringing copies of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works identified in this Complaint) because
Midjourney knowingly and materially contributes to, encourages, and induces such
infringement.
</p><p>
225. Midjourney has specific knowledge of, or is willfully blind to, the direct
infringement of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works done through its Image Service. At a
minimum, through their cease-and-desist letters, Plaintiffs put Midjourney on notice that
its Image Service was being used to infringe Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works and the specific
characters identified in the letter (see Exhibits C and D). Additionally, Midjourney has
knowledge of the direct infringement of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works through its ongoing
relationship with its subscribers as Midjourney publicly displays the infringing copies,
reproductions, and derivatives generated by its Image Service for its subscribers on the
Midjourney Explore page. Indeed, as shown above, Midjourney’s own website displays
hundreds, if not thousands, of images generated by its Image Service at the request of its
subscribers that infringe Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works. Midjourney also has specific
knowledge that Plaintiffs were being harmed in this District by its infringement of
Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
226. Midjourney specifically designed its Image Service to encourage, contribute
to and induce the reproduction, public display, distribution, and preparation of derivative
works of copyrighted works. As alleged above, Midjourney intentionally trained its Image
Service to readily produce and display reproductions and derivatives of Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works. Midjourney would not be able to create such infringing outputs
without its intentional design enabling that infringement.
</p><p>
227. Additionally, Midjourney has the means to take simple steps not to materially
contribute to the specific infringing activity but fails to do so. Midjourney has failed to
take reasonable, readily available, and cost-effective steps to purge its Image Service of
Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works identified in Plaintiffs’ cease-and-desist letters and its own


website promotional pages. Even more, Midjourney has the right and ability to limit its
Image Service’s ability to copy, reproduce, and prepare derivatives of Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works. Midjourney has failed to implement simple measures, such as
copyright protection measures, that would limit its Image Service’s ability to copy,
reproduce, and prepare derivatives of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works despite the
availability of such copyright protection measures and their use by other AI image-
generating services.
</p><p>
228. Instead of taking simple, available steps to not materially contribute,
encourage, or induce to the specific infringing activity, Midjourney actively facilitates the
ongoing infringement through its actions above. As a direct and proximate result,
Midjourney has secondarily infringed Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
229. Each act of secondary infringement by Midjourney constitutes a separate and
distinct act of infringement.
</p><p>
230. Midjourney’s acts of secondary infringement are willful, in disregard of and
with indifference to Plaintiffs’ rights.
</p><p>
231. Midjourney is purposefully exploiting Plaintiffs’ valuable intellectual
property to attract subscribers to Midjourney, and it is profiting by providing subscribers
with endless copies and derivatives of Plaintiffs’ Copyrighted Works.
</p><p>
232. Midjourney has failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the copyright
infringement of its subscribers. As a direct and proximate result of Midjourney’s
infringement, Plaintiffs are entitled to damages and Midjourney’s profits in an amount
according to proof.
</p><p>
233. Alternatively, and at their election, Plaintiffs are entitled to statutory damages,
up to $150,000 per infringed work by virtue of Midjourney’s willful infringement, or for
such other amounts as may be proper under 17 U.S.C. § 504.
</p><p>
234. Plaintiffs are further entitled to recover their attorneys’ fees and full costs
pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 505.


</p><p>
235. As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts and conduct, Plaintiffs
have sustained and will continue to sustain substantial and irreparable injury, for which
there is no adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined and restrained by this Court,
Midjourney will continue to infringe Plaintiffs’ rights in their Copyrighted Works.
Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief under 17 U.S.C. § 502.
<h2>RELIEF</h2>
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment as follows:
</p><p>
1. For Plaintiffs’ damages and Midjourney’s profits in such amount as may be
found; alternatively, at Plaintiffs’ election, for maximum statutory damages; or for such
other amounts as may be proper pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(c);
</p><p>
2. For an accounting, the imposition of a constructive trust, restitution of
Midjourney’s unlawful proceeds from copyright infringement, and damages according to
proof;
</p><p>
3. For preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief enjoining and restraining
Midjourney and all of its officers, agents, servants, and employees and all persons acting
in concert or participation with Midjourney, from: (a) infringing Plaintiffs’ exclusive rights
under the Copyright Act by copying, publicly displaying and/or distributing Plaintiffs’
Copyrighted Works, (b) offering its Image Service without appropriate copyright
protection measures to prevent such infringement, (c) offering its forthcoming Video
Service without appropriate copyright protection measures to prevent such infringement,
and (d) otherwise engaging in the copyright infringement conduct described above;
</p><p>
4. For prejudgment interest according to law;
</p><p>
5. For attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 505; and
</p><p>
6. Any further and additional relief the Court may deem just and proper.
