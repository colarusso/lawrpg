What they worked on this week, including any assigned readings.\n2. What about their process worked for them.\n3. What about their process didn't work for them. \n4. What suggestions they might have for doing things differently next week. \n\nAs a general approach, meet them where they are, but gently push for more detail. You need to be convinced that they actually did the work and that they've really thought about their process. If they didn't mention any readings, ask them if they had any readings this week. You don't need to interrogate them, just be sure they have engaged with your questions in good faith before moving on.\n\nDon't ask all your questions at once, let them come up in conversation. \n",

  "Socrates": {
    "prompt": "You are an actor playing a law school professor conducting a Socratic dialogue. In this scene you are interacting with a student, asking them questions about a case. Below I will provide you with documents from the case for you to work with. Your job is to stay in character and act out your part. You are aiming for a realistic performance. To help you get into character, here is some background information.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nYou're character is very similar in demeanor to Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. in the Paper Chase. You are hard but fair, and see your role in class as that of Socrates. You're job is to have students come to understand the material through guided questions. The following is how you have described what you try to do for each dialogue. \n\nPreparation\n\n    - Choose a Case: Select a legal case that presents complex issues.\n    - Identify Issues: Pinpoint the main legal issues and principles in the case.\n    - Develop Questions: Create a sequence of questions ranging from broad to specific to guide the discussion.\n\nConducting the Dialogue\n\n    - Start Broad: Initiate with questions that summarize the case and identify issues.\n    - Probe Deeper: Continue with questions that analyze arguments, evaluate reasoning, and apply principles.\n    - Encourage Participation: Foster an inclusive atmosphere for all students to contribute.\n    - Guide Discussion: Facilitate the dialogue, connecting ideas and challenging assumptions.\n    - Clarify and Summarize: Regularly clarify points and summarize key takeaways.\n\nDeepening Understanding\n\n    - Reflect on Discussion: Encourage students to consider the broader implications and applications.\n    - Integrate Perspectives: Where relevant, bring in ethical, historical, or societal contexts.\n    - Provide Feedback: Offer constructive feedback on students' analyses.\n\nConcluding the Dialogue\n\n    - Wrap-Up: Summarize the discussion's main insights and their relevance.\n    - Connect Themes: Link the dialogue to overarching course themes.\n\nRemember, the case you are working with will be provided in an upload from the user. \n\nDIRECTION\n\nBe sure to keep your questions and responses short. You \"speak in sentences not paragraphs.\" Short and conversational, no speechifying!\n\nAfter you are provided with the case document(s), start the conversation by asking the user to \"Please describe the facts of the case.\"\n\nThink about how your character would respond and craft an appropriate reply. Remember, you are a law professor conducting a Socratic dialogue. Your goal is to embody your character while achieving a naturalistic believable performance. You will continue to play the part of your character throughout the conversation. Whatever happens, do NOT break character! \n\nIf the first user interaction doesn't involve uploading case documents, ask for them to do so.\n\n=======================================================\n\nHere are the case documents: \n\n============\n{{passThrough[\"case_text\"]}}",

    "prompt": "You are an actor serving as a judge in a moot court. In this scene you are interacting with a student, asking them questions about a case. Below I will provide you with documents from the case for you to work with. Your job is to stay in character and act out your part. You are aiming for a realistic performance. To help you get into character, here is some background information.\n\nYou are acting as a judge for a student attorney arguing a hypothetical case. A set of court documents that describe the case are provided below. You should start by asking the student attorney to state what side they are representing. Then lead right into questioning them about the merits of their case. \n\nYour role is to guide the proceedings, ensure fairness, and assess the students' understanding of the law and their ability to argue effectively. Here’s a short set of instructions to help you:\n\n1. Maintain Professionalism and Neutrality:\n\n    Conduct the proceedings with the same level of formality and seriousness as a real appellate court.\n    Remain impartial and do not show bias toward either side.\n\n2. Initiate the Session:\n\n    Begin by outlining the format of the proceedings.\n    Call on the student attorney to state what side they represent and to present their argument.\n\n3. Guide the Oral Argument:\n\n    Allow the student attorney to begin their argument, but be prepared to interject with questions throughout.\n    Engage actively with the attorney, posing questions that test their understanding, challenge their reasoning, or clarify their position.\n    Allow the attorney to respond fully before moving on to the next question or point.\n\n4. Ask Questions Thoughtfully and Strategically:\n\n    Use questions to probe the strengths and weaknesses of the attorney’s argument, much like in a real appellate court.\n    Challenge the attorney to defend their position under scrutiny, encouraging deep legal analysis.\n    Be respectful, but persistent in questioning to simulate the rigorous examination typical in appellate courts.\n\n5. Control the Dialogue:\n\n    Maintain control over the flow of the conversation, ensuring it stays focused on the legal issues at hand.\n    Politely steer the discussion back on track if the attorney digresses.\n\n6. Provide Constructive Feedback:\n\n    After the attorney concludes their argument, by saying something like, \"I rest my case,\" offer specific and constructive feedback.\n    Comment on the effectiveness of their legal reasoning, their responses to questions, and their overall presentation.\n    Be sure to include feedback that incorporates their opponent's likely arguments (as inferred from the court documents)\n    Suggest ways they could improve their performance in future arguments.\n\n7. Encourage and Motivate:\n\n    Conclude the session by acknowledging the effort and preparation of all participants.\n    Reinforce the educational value of the exercise and encourage the students to continue refining their advocacy skills.\n\nBy focusing on active engagement and thoughtful questioning, you can create a realistic and challenging appellate argument experience for the student attorneys.\n\n=======================================================\n\nHere are the case documents: \n\n============\n{{passThrough[\"case_text\"]}}\n\n=======================================================\n\nNow begin acting as the judge in the case, provide only your dialog, no need to prepend it with something like \"JUDGE:\" When speaking, think about how your character would speak and craft an appropriate reply.

As Mr. Valenti spoke, the entertainment industry\\u2019s claims of copyright infringement\\r\\nwere headed to the Supreme Court after years of litigation. The Court ultimately rejected the\\r\\nalarmism and voted for technological innovation and consumer choice, with its seminal decision\\r\\nin Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. freeing consumers from broadcast\\r\\nschedules and ushering in an on-demand world. And that decision did not destroy Hollywood\\u2014\\r\\nquite the opposite, the entertainment industry flourished when the VCR opened new markets and\\r\\nrevenue streams. But at the time, empty warnings nearly won the day. As one New York Times\\r\\nreporter recalled three decades later: \\u201CThe Supreme Court almost bought\\u201D the argument.2\\r\\nIn this case, The New York Times uses its might and its megaphone to challenge the latest\\r\\nprofound technological advance: the Large Language Model, or LLM. LLMs are a breakthrough\\r\\nin artificial intelligence. The LLMs at issue here are created by feeding large amounts of text\\r\\nthrough a machine learning algorithm called a \\u201Ctransformer,\\u201D which breaks the text into\\r\\nconstituent \\u201Ctokens,\\u201D then learns the statistical relationships among them. This allows an LLM\\r\\nto generate brand new natural language content in response to user prompts. LLMs can also be\\r\\ntrained to perform countless tasks, from translation, to computer coding, to ad copy, to research.\\r\\n1 Home Recording of Copyrighted Works: Hearing on H.R.4783, H.R. 4794, H.R. 4808, H.R.\\r\\n5250, H.R. 5488, and H.R. 5705 Before the H.

Because Microsoft firmly\\r\\nbelieves in LLMs\\u2019 capacity to improve the way people live and work, it has collaborated with\\r\\nOpenAI to help bring their extraordinary power to the public, while leading the way in\\r\\npromoting safe and responsible AI development.\\r\\nDespite The Times\\u2019s contentions, copyright law is no more an obstacle to the LLM than it\\r\\nwas to the VCR (or the player piano, copy machine, personal computer, internet, or search\\r\\nengine). Content used to train LLMs does not supplant the market for the works, it teaches the\\r\\nmodels language. It is the essence of what copyright law considers transformative\\u2014and fair\\u2014\\r\\nuse: A program called a \\u201Ctransformer\\u201D evaluates massive amounts of text, converts that text into\\r\\ntrillions of constituent parts, discerns the relationships among all of them, and yields a natural\\r\\nlanguage machine that can respond to human prompts.

Rather, The Times crafted unrealistic prompts to try to coax the GPT-\\r\\nbased tools to output snippets of text matching The Times\\u2019s content\\u2014a technique The Times\\r\\nburies in lengthy exhibits to the Complaint. Nowhere does The Times allege that anyone other\\r\\nthan its legal team would actually do any of this, and certainly not on a scale that merits thedoomsday futurology it pushes before this Court and has boosted to its readers.\\r\\nThree claims in particular should be dismissed. First, The Times alleges that Microsoft is\\r\\ncontributorily liable for end-user copyright infringement through use of GPT-based tools. But it\\r\\nalleges no end-user infringement at all, and thus no knowledge on Microsoft\\u2019s part that end-users\\r\\nare making infringing use of LLMs that have a universe of entirely lawful uses. The claim is\\r\\ntherefore the exact one the Supreme Court rejected when it blessed the VCR. Part I, infra.\\r\\nSecond, The Times alleges that Microsoft violated the Digital Millennium Copyright\\r\\nAct\\u2019s \\u201Ccopyright management information\\u201D\\u2014or CMI\\u2014provisions. See 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 1202(b).\\r\\nThose provisions are designed to prevent defendants from removing CMI from a copy of a work\\r\\nwhere doing so is likely to facilitate infringement or make it harder to detect. The Times never\\r\\nexplains how this would happen in the real world. Its only examples are derived from its own\\r\\nprompts for particular Times content, which would require the user to already know the genesis\\r\\nof that content. And in any event, the outputs the Complaint cites are not copies of works at all,\\r\\nbut mere snippets that are not cognizable under \\u00A7 1202(b). Part II, infra.\\r\\nThird, The Times repackages its copyright claims based on GPT-model outputs as state-\\r\\nlaw misappropriation torts, suggesting that the GPT-based tools appropriate \\u201Ctime-sensitive\\u201D\\r\\nnews and Wirecutter reviews. Again, this is purely theoretical. But even if it were not, the\\r\\nclaims are preempted by the Copyright Act, which does not permit plaintiffs to evade key\\r\\nlimitations like fair use by dressing up copyright claims as state-law torts. Directly applicable\\r\\nSecond Circuit law mandates this result. Part III, infra.\\r\\nOnce the claims challenged here are dismissed, Microsoft looks forward to litigating the\\r\\nissues in this case that are genuinely presented, and to vindicating the important values of\\r\\nprogress, learning, and the sharing of knowledge.ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT\\r\\nA. Large Language Models Are A Profound Advance In Artificial Intelligence\\r\\nAnd A Powerful Tool For Human Flourishing.\\r\\nOver the past several years, researchers and engineers have made dramatic advances in\\r\\nthe field of artificial intelligence. Perhaps the most astounding is the \\u201Clarge language model,\\u201D or\\r\\nLLM. As relevant here, an LLM is a machine learning model that can process and produce\\r\\nnatural language text. Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 61, 64, 75.\\r\\nAt the heart of an LLM is a computer algorithm called a \\u201Ctransformer.\\u201D See Compl. \\u00B6 83.\\r\\nTo create a model, engineers engage in a step called \\u201Ctraining,\\u201D in which they feed large amounts\\r\\nof text through the transformer. Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 75, 77. As this happens, the LLM separates the text\\r\\ninto \\u201Ctokens\\u201D\\u2014words, punctuation, and so forth. See Compl. \\u00B6 91. Across the entire \\u201Ctraining\\r\\nset\\u201D or \\u201Ctraining corpus,\\u201D the model then discerns semantic patterns among tokens, which it\\r\\n\\u201Cencode[s] \\u2026 as numbers called \\u2018parameters.\\u2019\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 77. A highly sophisticated model\\r\\ntrained on a large corpus might have trillions of tokens and parameters. See, e.g., Compl. \\u00B6 91\\r\\n(alleging that GPT-4 contains \\u201C13 trillion tokens\\u201D and \\u201C1.8 trillion parameters\\u201D). It is this\\r\\nextensive network of semantic connections that allows the model to emit natural-language text.\\r\\nCompl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 75-77.\\r\\nLLMs are sometimes referred to as \\u201Cgeneral purpose\\u201D or \\u201Cfoundational\\u201D AI models\\r\\nbecause their language capabilities have many applications. For example, \\u201C[o]nce trained, LLMs\\r\\nmay be provided with information specific to a use case or subject matter,\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 81,\\r\\nenabling them to assist a human user with that use case or subject. That user directs the LLM\\u2019s\\r\\nperformance through user-selected \\u201Cprompts\\u201D to which the model responds. Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 61, 76.\\r\\nAs reflected in various sources incorporated by reference into the Complaint, Microsoft\\r\\nbelieves that LLMs \\u201Ccan so deeply absorb the nuances of language, grammar, knowledge,concepts, and context that [they] can excel at multiple tasks,\\u201D promising untold applications that\\r\\nwill improve people\\u2019s lives.

Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 158-204. The first count of the Complaint alleges that Microsoft engaged indirect copyright infringement based on theories involving \\u201Ctraining\\u201D of OpenAI\\u2019s models,\\r\\nCompl. \\u00B6 161; \\u201Cstoring, processing, and reproducing the GPT models \\u2026 on Microsoft\\u2019s\\r\\nsupercomputing platform,\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 162; and \\u201Cdisseminating generative output\\u201D to users,\\r\\nCompl. \\u00B6 164. The second two counts allege vicarious and contributory infringement against\\r\\nMicrosoft for its role in the direct infringement by OpenAI alleged in Count I. See Compl.\\r\\n\\u00B6\\u00B6 169-73 (vicarious infringement); Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 174-77 (contributory infringement). These three\\r\\nclaims are not at issue in this motion. As the Complaint anticipates in its assertion that creating\\r\\nan LLM is not \\u201Ctransformative,\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 8, these claims will ultimately turn, among other\\r\\nthings, on a fair-use defense under 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 107 not suited to the pleading stage. The\\r\\nComplaint\\u2019s seventh cause of action\\u2014a trademark tarnishment theory suggesting that \\u201Clower\\r\\nquality and inaccurate\\u201D output could \\u201Cdilute[] the quality of The Times\\u2019s trademarks\\u201D\\u2014is also\\r\\nnot at issue in this motion. Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 198-204; see 15 U.S.C. 1125(c).\\r\\nAt issue here are Counts IV, V, and VI. The fourth count alleges an alternative theory of\\r\\ncontributory infringement against Microsoft and OpenAI. Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 178-80. This claim\\r\\nanticipates another defense to one of the direct infringement claims\\u2014that it is the user, not\\r\\nMicrosoft or OpenAI, who is the direct infringer if its \\u201Cuser-generated prompt[],\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 61,\\r\\nresults in an infringing output. The Complaint alleges that \\u201Cto the extent an end-user may be\\r\\nliable as a direct infringer based on output of the GPT-based products, Defendants materially\\r\\ncontributed to and directly assisted with the direct infringement perpetrated by end-users.\\u201D\\r\\nCompl. \\u00B6 179. It claims that \\u201CDefendants knew or had reason to know\\u201D of infringement because\\r\\nthey were \\u201Caware that \\u2026 GPT-based products are capable of distributing unlicensed copies or\\r\\nderivatives of copyrighted Times works.\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 180 (emphasis added).\\r\\nThe Complaint\\u2019s fifth cause of action alleges violation of \\u00A7 1202 of the DMCA, whichprotects against the removal of \\u201Ccopyright management information,\\u201D or CMI, from copies of\\r\\nworks. The Complaint alleges that Microsoft and OpenAI \\u201Cremoved The Times\\u2019s copyright-\\r\\nmanagement information\\u201D in \\u201Cbuilding the training datasets,\\u201D \\u201Cgenerating synthetic search\\r\\nresults,\\u201D and \\u201Cgenerating outputs from the GPT models.\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 184-87 (invoking 17 U.S.C.\\r\\n\\u00A7 1202(b)(1)).

Compl. \\u00B6 189 (invoking 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 1202(b)(3)).\\r\\nThe Complaint\\u2019s sixth cause of action alleges common law unfair competition by\\r\\nmisappropriation. The Times alleges that \\u201C[b]y offering content that is created by GenAI but is\\r\\nthe same or similar to content published by The Times, Defendants\\u2019 GPT models directly\\r\\ncompete with Times content.\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 194. The Complaint alleges that Defendants\\r\\nmisappropriate \\u201Ctime-sensitive breaking news\\u201D and consumer purchasing \\u201Crecommendations\\u201D\\r\\nfrom the Wirecutter website. Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 193-94.\\r\\nD. The Complaint Alleges No Real-World Instance of Output of The Times\\u2019s\\r\\nWorks or Impact to The Times\\u2019s Rights.\\r\\nThe Complaint is filled with attempts to establish that GPT-based products \\u201Cwill output\\r\\nnear-verbatim copies of significant portions of Times Works when prompted to do so.\\u201D Compl.\\r\\n\\u00B6 98; see Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 99-107. And it warns that if The Times does not prevail in this case, the\\r\\n\\u201Ccost to society will be enormous.\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 48. And yet its 68 pages and 204 paragraphs of\\r\\nallegations do not contain a single allegation concerning something that has actually happened in\\r\\nthe real world as a result of the development, offering, or use of GPT-based products.\\r\\nThe Times is at pains to insinuate that with \\u201Cminimal prompting\\u201D these products \\u201Cwill\\r\\nrecite large portions\\u201D of The Times\\u2019s works, Compl. \\u00B6 99, offering various examples that\\r\\ncompare the text of an article to model output. But The Times buries this \\u201Cminimal prompting\\u201D\\r\\nin an exhibit, where it admits that its prompts each \\u201Ccomprise[] a short snippet from thebeginning of an article from The New York Times\\u201D\\u2014often verbatim snippets of paragraphs on\\r\\nend. Compl. Ex. J at 1. The Complaint does not explain why any real person, already in\\r\\npossession of a New York Times article, would ever want to feed part of that prompt into a GPT-\\r\\nbased product to generate a part of the rest of the article. It certainly does not allege that any real\\r\\nperson has done so. It has manufactured the story.\\r\\nSimilarly unsubstantiated are its various warnings of harm\\u2014from \\u201Cthreat[s] [to] high-\\r\\nquality journalism,\\u201D Compl. at 14 (capitalization omitted), to hindering its \\u201Cability to continue to\\r\\nattract and grow its digital subscriber base,\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 52, to \\u201Cdecreases in traffic to Wirecutter,\\u201D\\r\\nCompl. \\u00B6 128, to \\u201Cendanger[ment] [of] Wirecutter\\u2019s reputation by falsely attributing a product\\r\\nrecommendation to Wirecutter that it did not make,\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 135. All of this turns out to be\\r\\nmere speculation about what The Times apparently fears might happen. Indeed, the Complaint\\r\\ndoes not allege a single real-world example of any occurrence that could even begin to cause\\r\\nsuch harm, let alone allege that any such harms have materialized.\\r\\nARGUMENT\\r\\nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \\u201Ca complaint must contain sufficient\\r\\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\\u201D Ashcroft v.\\r\\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). If a claim lacks a cognizable\\r\\ntheory, lacks sufficient facts to plausibly support that theory, or advances a theory that is\\r\\nforeclosed as a matter of law, dismissal is appropriate. \\u201CThreadbare recitals of the elements of a\\r\\ncause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements,\\u201D are insufficient. Id.\\r\\nI. THE TIMES FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM FOR CONTRIBUTORY\\r\\nINFRINGEMENT BASED ON USER OUTPUTS.\\r\\nThe Times fails to state a claim that Microsoft has contributed to end-user copyright\\r\\ninfringement. See Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 178-80 (Count IV). A contributory infringer is \\u201Cone who, withknowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the infringing\\r\\nconduct of another.\\u201D Gershwin Publ\\u2019g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt., Inc., 443 F.2d 1159,\\r\\n1162 (2d Cir. 1971). The Complaint does not allege that Microsoft encouraged end-users to\\r\\nmake infringing use of any GPT-based product, acted in a way that would promote such\\r\\ninfringing use, or did anything to induce such infringing use. It advances only a \\u201Cmaterial\\r\\ncontribut[ion]\\u201D theory. Compl. \\u00B6 179. The notion is that by offering end-users products that it\\r\\nallegedly knows \\u201Care capable of distributing unlicensed copies or derivative[] \\u2026 works,\\u201D\\r\\nMicrosoft is a contributory infringer any time a user makes use of that capability. Compl. \\u00B6 180.\\r\\nThis theory fails for two reasons. First, The Times fails to allege any instance of direct\\r\\ninfringement by a user, a necessary prerequisite to a claim for secondary liability. Part I.A, infra.\\r\\nSecond, The Times cannot allege Microsoft\\u2019s actual knowledge of (or willful blindness to) any\\r\\nact of direct infringement. Part I.B, infra. The Times\\u2019s contributory infringement theory thus\\r\\nfails on the very same basis the challenge to the VCR failed four decades ago: It improperly\\r\\nseeks to impose liability based \\u201Csolely [on] the design or distribution of a product capable of\\r\\nsubstantial lawful use.\\u201D Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 933\\r\\n(2005). The claim should be dismissed.\\r\\nA. The Complaint Fails To Allege An Actionable Instance Of End-User Copyright\\r\\nInfringement.\\r\\n\\u201CContributory infringement necessarily must follow a finding of direct or primary\\r\\ninfringement.\\u201D Matthew Bender & Co. v. West Publ\\u2019g Co., 158 F.3d 693, 706 (2d Cir. 1998). To\\r\\nallege direct infringement, a plaintiff must plead (1) its \\u201Cownership of a valid copyright,\\u201D and (2)\\r\\na primary infringer\\u2019s \\u201Ccopying of constituent elements of the work that are original\\u201D\\u2014i.e.,\\r\\ninfringement of one of the rights protected under 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 106. Feist Publ\\u2019ns, Inc. v. Rural\\r\\nTel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991).In Matthew Bender, West Publishing Company, the publisher of the \\u201CNational Reporter\\r\\nSystem,\\u201D sued the publisher of electronic databases that collected judicial opinions. 158 F.3d at\\r\\n697. West alleged that a user of these databases could operate them to \\u201Cview (and print) judicial\\r\\nopinions in the same order in which they are printed in a West volume,\\u201D thus recreating West\\u2019s\\r\\nreporters. Id.

The Second Circuit rejected the claim. Though West \\u201Chypothesized that\\r\\nusers \\u2026 will retrieve and print cases in the order in which they appear in West\\u2019s case reporters,\\u201D\\r\\nit \\u201Cfailed to identify any primary infringer, other than [its own] counsel.\\u201D Id.\\r\\nThe Times has the same problem here. The Complaint \\u201Chypothesize[s]\\u201D that someone\\r\\ncould find a way to prompt the GPT-based products to yield output that is similar to one of The\\r\\nTimes\\u2019s works. It contains examples of prompts that yield small amounts of similar text\\u2014\\r\\nprompts like multi-paragraph passages of an article, Compl. Ex. J, or cumbersome, direct\\r\\nrequests for specific paragraphs of a specific piece. Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 117-23. But this is purely the\\r\\nwork of individuals directed by The Times. The Times does not allege that any actual user of a\\r\\nGPT-based product would prompt it this way, presumably because it lacks a good-faith basis for\\r\\nany such claim. The bare theoretical possibility that someone somewhere might engage in the\\r\\nsame acrobatics The Times did here is not enough to plausibly allege direct infringement. This\\r\\nwarrants dismissal of the claim. See Tremblay v. OpenAI, Inc., No. 23-cv-3223-AMO, 2024 WL\\r\\n557720, at *2-3 (N.D. Cal.

Of course, the same was true of the VCR\\u2014as it is of word\\r\\nprocessors, hard drives, social media feeds, internet connections, and so forth. Fortunately, the\\r\\nSupreme Court long ago rejected liability merely based on offering a multi-use product. Since\\r\\nSony, the law has barred liability based on \\u201Cthe equivocal conduct of selling an item with\\r\\nsubstantial lawful as well as unlawful uses,\\u201D \\u201Climit[ing] liability to instances of more acute fault\\r\\nthan the mere understanding that some of one\\u2019s products will be misused.\\u201D Grokster, 545 U.S. at\\r\\n932-33. \\u201C[T]he \\u2018substantial noninfringing use\\u2019 test is as applicable here as it was in Sony,\\u201D\\r\\nMatthew Bender, 158 F.3d at 707.

PLAINTIFF FAILS TO STATE A DMCA \\u00A7 1202 CLAIM.\\r\\nThe Times also fails to state a claim under either \\u00A7 1202(b)(1) or (b)(3) of the DMCA.\\r\\nSee Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 181-91 (Count V). Section 1202 is one of two adjoining provisions that aims to\\r\\nthwart digital piracy. S. Rep. No. 105-190 at 11 n.18 (1998) (DMCA aimed to \\u201Cdiscourage\\r\\npiracy\\u201D). It protects the \\u201C[i]ntegrity of copyright management information\\u201D\\u2014defined as\\r\\n\\u201Cinformation conveyed in connection with copies \\u2026 of a work\\u201D\\u2014on the rationale that removal\\r\\nor falsification of that information aids the spread of pirated copies. Id. at 8, 34. To state a claim\\r\\nunder \\u00A7 1202(b)(1), a plaintiff must allege that the defendant \\u201Cintentionally remov[ed] or\\r\\nalter[ed]\\u201D CMI from a copy of a work. 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 1202(b)(1). To state a claim under\\r\\n\\u00A7 1202(b)(3), a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the defendant \\u201Cdistribute[d]\\u201D copies of works\\r\\n\\u201Cknowing that [CMI] has been removed or altered without authority of the copyright owner[.]\\u201D\\r\\nAnd for both claims, a plaintiff must further establish that the defendant removed or distributed\\r\\nCMI \\u201Cknowing, or ... having reasonable grounds to know, that it will induce, enable, facilitate, or\\r\\nconceal an infringement of any right under this title.\\u201D 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 1202(b).Over the past 18 months, plaintiffs seeking to challenge generative AI tools have\\r\\nrepeatedly tried and failed to adequately allege claims under \\u00A7 1202.3 These decisions form an\\r\\nemerging judicial consensus that neither the highly technical process of training an LLM nor the\\r\\ngenerated outputs of that LLM implicate the sort of piracy concerns animating \\u00A7 1202. The\\r\\nTimes fails for the same reasons others have. First, it cannot allege Microsoft\\u2019s culpable\\r\\nawareness that removal of CMI will \\u201Cinduce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement\\u201D of\\r\\nThe Times\\u2019s works. Part II.A, infra. And second, it cannot allege the removal of CMI from\\r\\nidentical copies of The Times\\u2019s works, as required. Part II.B, infra.\\r\\nA. The Complaint Does Not Plausibly Allege Microsoft\\u2019s Intent To Induce, Enable,\\r\\nFacilitate, Or Conceal Infringement By Removal Of CMI.\\r\\nSection 1202 does not impose liability on a defendant whose removal of CMI has only\\r\\nthe incidental effect of aiding or concealing copyright infringement. It enacts this limitation\\r\\nthrough a stringent \\u201Cdouble-scienter requirement.\\u201D Mango v. BuzzFeed, Inc., 970 F.3d 167, 172\\r\\n(2d Cir. 2020). The first half of the requirement demands that the defendant\\u2019s conduct\\u2014removal\\r\\nof CMI, alteration of CMI, and so forth\\u2014be intentional (for subsection (b)(1)) or knowing (for\\r\\nsubsection (b)(3)).

But it makes no sense\\r\\nto base a CMI claim on alleged infringement during training. The point of CMI, and thus\\r\\n\\u00A7 1202\\u2019s protections, is to \\u201Cinform the public that something is copyrighted.\\u201D Roberts v.\\r\\nBroadwayHD LLC, 518 F. Supp. 3d 719, 737 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (emphasis added); Fashion Nova,\\r\\nLLC v. Blush Mark, Inc., No. 22-cv-6127, 2023 WL 4307646, at *5 (C.D. Cal. June 30, 2023)\\r\\n(\\u201C[T]he purpose of CMI is to provide the public with notice that a work is copyrighted.\\u201D)(emphasis added). Training takes place out of public view, and training data itself is not\\r\\ndisseminated. That is why the court in Tremblay rejected the theory that \\u201Cknowing removal of\\r\\nCMI from \\u2026 books during the training process\\u201D could violate \\u00A7 1202. 2024 WL 557720, at *4.\\r\\nIn any event, the Complaint concedes away any claim that Microsoft intends to facilitate\\r\\ninfringement during training by acknowledging Microsoft\\u2019s strong belief that \\u201Cthi[s] conduct is\\r\\nprotected as \\u2018fair use.\\u2019\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 8. As \\u00A7 107 of the Copyright Act makes plain, \\u201Cthe fair use of\\r\\na copyrighted work \\u2026 is not an infringement of copyright,\\u201D (emphasis added). And the\\r\\nComplaint does not allege that Microsoft\\u2019s belief in its fair use rights is ingenuine or objectively\\r\\nunreasonable. Microsoft\\u2019s good-faith, objectively reasonable belief that it is engaging in fair\\r\\nuse\\u2014and therefore not infringing at all\\u2014thus negates any inference that it knew or should have\\r\\nknown it was facilitating or concealing infringement by allegedly removing CMI. Cf. Mango,\\r\\n970 F.3d at 173 (relying on defendant\\u2019s acknowledgement that \\u201Che was required to get\\r\\npermission\\u201D that removal of CMI would \\u201Cwrongfully impl[y] \\u2026 permission\\u201D).\\r\\nAllegedly infringing output. The Complaint also fails to allege Microsoft\\u2019s scienter with\\r\\nrespect to allegedly infringing output from a GPT-based product. This is for much the same\\r\\nreason The Times\\u2019s theory of contributory infringement fails: The Complaint does not plausibly\\r\\nallege actual user conduct that yields infringing outputs in the first place, so it cannot possibly\\r\\nraise the inference that Microsoft somehow intended, knew about, or should have known about\\r\\nsuch behavior. See supra 10-13. Again, the allegedly infringing outputs contained in the\\r\\nComplaint have been manufactured for purposes of the Complaint. Nowhere does the Complaint\\r\\nallege that any real-world user does or is likely to use any of the GPT-products in the manner The\\r\\nTimes has in drafting its Complaint. And nowhere does the Complaint allege that if end-usersdid make this sort of use, the alleged absence of CMI would in any way facilitate that\\r\\ninfringement or make it harder to police it than it would be if CMI were preserved.\\r\\nIndeed, any such claim would again be nonsensical. The Times generated the examples\\r\\nin its Complaint by specifically inputting or requesting New York Times content. If someone\\r\\nalready has a New York Times article with which to prompt ChatGPT, or already has the title of\\r\\nthe article to enter as a prompt, the presence or absence of CMI is irrelevant. The user already\\r\\nknows where the article is from. In such a situation, even if any mere removal of CMI is\\r\\nplausibly alleged, it would be immaterial to a claim under \\u00A7 1202(b).\\r\\nThe Ninth Circuit\\u2019s decision in Stevens v. Corelogic, Inc. is on point. 899 F.3d 666, 675\\r\\n(9th Cir. 2018). Stevens involved the defendant\\u2019s removal of CMI metadata from photographs as\\r\\npart of technological \\u201C[d]ownsampling\\u201D\\u2014i.e., compression. Id. at 671. Plaintiff photographers\\r\\nsuggested that this somehow would aid infringement. But they \\u201Cha[d] not \\u2026 averred that they\\r\\nha[d] ever used CMI metadata to prevent or detect copyright infringement.\\u201D Id. at 675. Nor\\r\\ncould they establish that the defendant was aware of a third-party \\u201Cpattern of conduct\\u201D or\\r\\n\\u201Cestablished modus operandi\\u201D that might give rise to an inference that the defendant was \\u201Caware\\r\\nof the probable future impact of its actions\\u201D with respect to CMI. Id. at 674. The plaintiffs\\r\\ntherefore could not establish that any removal of CMI was done with an awareness that it would\\r\\nfacilitate infringement. Id. at 675. The Times\\u2019s claim falls short for the same reason. See\\r\\nTremblay, 2024 WL 557720, at *4-5 (dismissing CMI claim for failure to allege requisite\\r\\nscienter).\\r\\nB. The Complaint Does Not Plausibly Allege \\u201CRemoval\\u201D Of CMI From Copies Of\\r\\nIdentical Works.\\r\\nThe Times\\u2019s CMI claims fail for the further reason that the Complaint does not allege the\\r\\nactive \\u201Cremoval\\u201D of CMI from an identical copy of a work, as required under \\u00A7 1202(b). Asexplained above (at 13-14), \\u00A7 1202(b) is an anti-piracy statute\\u2014it protects the integrity of CMI\\r\\nnot for its own sake, but to thwart the creation and trafficking of pirated copies of works.\\r\\nSeveral aspects of the text bear this out. First, \\u00A7 1202 explicitly defines CMI as \\u201Cinformation\\r\\nconveyed in connection with copies \\u2026 of a work,\\u201D (emphasis added)\\u2014that is, in connection with\\r\\nthe \\u201Cmaterial objects\\u201D in which the work is \\u201Cfixed,\\u201D 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 101\\u2014and not, more abstractly,\\r\\nwith the underlying work itself. And second, \\u00A7 1202(b)(1) and (b)(3) use the term \\u201Cremove,\\u201D\\r\\nwhich connotes some active conduct. To \\u201Cremove\\u201D is \\u201Cto move by lifting, pushing aside, or\\r\\ntaking away or off\\u201D or \\u201Cto get rid of.\\u201D Webster\\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1921\\r\\n(1993).\\r\\nApplying these statutory terms, courts have consistently rejected \\u00A7 1202(b) claims where\\r\\na defendant allegedly removed CMI from\\u2014or merely failed to transpose CMI to\\u2014an excerpt or\\r\\nmodification of the original copy with which the CMI was included. Courts have thus rejected\\r\\nclaims based on mere \\u201Cframing\\u201D of a photograph in a way that does not include CMI, Falkner v.\\r\\nGen. Motors LLC, 393 F. Supp. 3d 927, 938-39 (C.D.

With respect to alleged removal of CMI from \\u201Csynthetic search\\r\\nresults\\u201D returned by the GPT-based Bing tools, the Complaint vaguely refers to \\u201Ccopies\\u201D and\\r\\n\\u201Cderivatives of Times Works,\\u201D without explaining what precisely is at issue.

Doe 1, 2024 WL 235217, at *8-9.\\r\\nEnd-user outputs. Similarly deficient are the Complaint\\u2019s allegations with respect to\\r\\nChatGPT outputs\\u2014the ones returned in response to explicit requests for New York Times content.\\r\\nAs the Complaint acknowledges, even these prompts generate only \\u201Cverbatim excerpts\\u201D (which,\\r\\nof course, the prompter already knows are from the New York Times).

See supra 18-19 (collecting cases).\\r\\nTraining materials.

It is not clear what The Times is alleging here, because nothing in the Complaint\\r\\ndescribes the \\u201Cscraping\\u201D or \\u201Cbuilding\\u201D The Times alleges. This vague allegation fails to identify\\r\\nany actual copy from which CMI is allegedly removed. And in any event, as explained above (at\\r\\n15-16), the act of removal of CMI during the training process could never give rise to a claim\\r\\nbecause training takes place out of public view and training data is not disseminated.\\r\\nThe Complaint\\u2019s failure to allege removal of CMI from a substantially identical copy\\r\\nfurther merits dismissal of the \\u00A7 1202(b)(1) and (b)(3) claims.\\r\\nIII. PLAINTIFF\\u2019S MISAPPROPRIATION CLAIM IS PREEMPTED BY THE\\r\\nCOPYRIGHT ACT.\\r\\nThe Times\\u2019s state-law misappropriation claim should be dismissed as preempted by \\u00A7 301\\r\\nof the Copyright Act. See Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 192-97 (Count VI). Section 301 preempts \\u201Clegal or\\r\\nequitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of\\r\\ncopyright \\u2026 and come within the subject matter of copyright.\\u201D 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 301(a). It thus\\r\\noperates to bar a claim that sounds in copyright, but that masquerades as a state law tort so as to\\r\\navoid copyright law\\u2019s limits\\u2014for example, the fair-use defense that safeguards a wide range of\\r\\ninterests by inherently limiting the scope of the copyright monopoly.\\r\\nThough the Complaint is unclear, The Times appears to try on two disguises. Both are\\r\\nfamiliar in the Second Circuit, and both fail under controlling precedent. First, The Times\\r\\ninsinuates (though never quite alleges) that Defendants misappropriate its \\u201Ctime-sensitivebreaking news.\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 193. But the Complaint falls far short of the sort of \\u201Cnarrow \\u2018hot-\\r\\nnews\\u2019 misappropriation claim [that] survives preemption\\u201D under National Basketball Ass\\u2019n v.\\r\\nMotorola, Inc., 105 F.3d 841, 852 (2d Cir. 1997). Part III.A, infra. Second, The Times claims\\r\\nmisappropriation of its \\u201CWirecutter recommendations.\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 194. But the Second Circuit\\r\\nfound materially identical \\u201Crecommendations\\u201D preempted in Barclays Capital Inc. v.\\r\\nTheflyonthewall.com, Inc., 650 F.3d 876, 902-07 (2d Cir. 2011). Part III.B, infra.\\r\\nA. The Complaint Fails To Satisfy The Narrow \\u201CHot News\\u201D Exception To\\r\\nPreemption.\\r\\nIn NBA v. Motorola, Inc., the Court repeatedly \\u201Cemphasize[d] the narrowness of state\\r\\nmisappropriation claims that survive preemption,\\u201D and described the law as only \\u201Cbegrudgingly\\u201D\\r\\npermitting certain \\u201Chot-news\\u201D misappropriation claims to survive preemption. 105 F.3d 841,\\r\\n851-52 (2d Cir. 1997). At times, the Complaint seems to be attempting to state such a claim. As\\r\\npart of its misappropriation allegations, the Complaint alleges that \\u201C[t]he Times gathers\\r\\ninformation, which often takes the form of time-sensitive breaking news, for its content at a\\r\\nsubstantial cost to The Times.\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 193. And the Complaint\\u2019s factual allegations allege\\r\\nthat Bing Chat and Browse with Bing can be used for \\u201Cunauthorized retrieval and dissemination\\r\\nof current news.\\u201D Compl. at 37 (capitalization omitted). In the examples the Complaint\\r\\nprovides, The Times specifically requested either Bing Chat or Browse with Bing to provide a\\r\\nparticular New York Times article that \\u201Cmay not have been included in the model\\u2019s training set.\\u201D\\r\\nCompl. \\u00B6 108. The notion seems to be that by combining Bing\\u2019s search engine functionality with\\r\\na GPT-based model, the tool could theoretically retrieve information from news articles.\\r\\nIf this is indeed an attempt to plead a viable hot-news claim, it fails under the well-\\r\\nestablished framework for evaluating preemption as applied in NBA. As in NBA, The Times\\u2019s\\r\\nclaim here implicates the \\u201Csubject matter\\u201D of copyright\\u2014the first requirement of the preemptionanalysis. Although The Times\\u2019s news content may include both \\u201Ccopyrightable\\u201D expression and\\r\\n\\u201Cuncopyrightable events [and] facts,\\u201D both of these come \\u201Cwithin the ambit of copyright\\r\\nprotection\\u201D for preemption purposes. 105 F.3d at 848-49. (Were it otherwise, a plaintiff could\\r\\nuse state law to evade \\u00A7 102(b) of the Copyright Act\\u2019s carefully drawn limits on protectable\\r\\nsubject matter.)\\r\\nAs for the second inquiry\\u2014whether the claim \\u201Cinvolves extra elements\\u201D and therefore\\r\\nasserts rights that are \\u201Cnot the equivalent of exclusive rights under a copyright\\u201D\\u2014NBA explained\\r\\nprecisely what a plaintiff would need to allege in order to evade preemption: \\u201C(i) the time-\\r\\nsensitive value of factual information, (ii) the free-riding by a defendant, and (iii) the threat to the\\r\\nvery existence of the product or service provided by the plaintiff.\\u201D 105 F.3d at 850, 853. The\\r\\nComplaint\\u2019s attempt to make out these elements is woefully deficient. While it references \\u201Ctime-\\r\\nsensitive\\u201D news, the Complaint neither defines that term nor alleges that Defendants\\u2019 tools\\r\\ndisseminate that time-sensitive news \\u201Cprecisely at the point where the profit is to be reaped,\\u201D id.\\r\\nat 851 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Complaint therefore alleges \\u201Cneither the quantity\\r\\nof copying nor the immediacy of distribution necessary to sustain a \\u2018hot\\u2019 news claim.\\u201D Fin. Info.,\\r\\nInc. v. Moody\\u2019s Invs. Serv., Inc., 808 F.2d 204, 209 (2d Cir. 1986).\\r\\nThe story told by the Complaint of years of supercomputer development and training of\\r\\nmodels prior to release is inconsistent with the premise that the models are spitting out today\\u2019s\\r\\nnews, and casts considerable doubt on its plausibility. But even if the premise were plausible,\\r\\nthe Complaint\\u2019s naked assertions that GPT-based tools \\u201Cdirectly compete with Times content,\\u201D\\r\\nCompl. \\u00B6 194, and will hamper \\u201Cits current level of groundbreaking journalism,\\u201D Compl. \\u00B6 157,\\r\\nare not. Nothing in the Complaint remotely substantiates these dubious claims with real-worldfacts. It thus fails to allege the GPT-based tools \\u201Cwould so reduce the incentive to produce\\u201D its\\r\\ncontent \\u201Cthat its existence or quality would be substantially threatened.\\u201D NBA, 105 F.3d at 845.\\r\\nCourts applying NBA have routinely found hot-news claims preempted at the pleading\\r\\nstage. E.g., ML Genius Holdings LLC v. Google LLC, No. 20-3113, 2022 WL 710744, at *5-6\\r\\n(2d Cir. 2022); DBW Partners, LLC v. Mkt. Sec., LLC, No. 22-cv-1333-BAH, 2023 WL\\r\\n2610498, at *5 (D.D.C. Mar. 23, 2023); see also Greer v. Fox News Media, No. 22-1970, 2023\\r\\nWL 2671796, at *2 (2d Cir. 2023) (finding preemption as a matter of law). This Court should do\\r\\nso here.\\r\\nB. The Recommendations-Based Claim Is Preempted.\\r\\nThe Times\\u2019s Wirecutter recommendation theory fails for similar reasons. The Complaint\\r\\nasserts that \\u201CWirecutter \\u2026 compiles and produces time-sensitive recommendations for readers.\\u201D\\r\\nCompl. \\u00B6 193. (It ventures no explanation of how its product reviews are \\u201Ctime sensitive.\\u201D) It\\r\\nthen offers examples where The Times itself prompted Bing Chat or Browse with Bing by asking\\r\\nit to return Wirecutter recommendations, in response to which the GPT-based tools summarized\\r\\nWirecutter recommendations. Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 127-35. The Complaint alleges that on the Wirecutter\\r\\nwebsite, the recommendations contain hyperlinks to purchase the recommended products, which\\r\\ncan lead to commissions for Wirecutter. Compl. \\u00B6 128. Because the GPT-based tools do not\\r\\ninclude these links, the Complaint alleges, Wirecutter would not receive its commission if the\\r\\nuser purchases one of the recommended products. Compl. \\u00B6\\u00B6 128-29. The Times dubs this\\r\\n\\u201Cmisappropriation of commercial referrals,\\u201D Compl. at 48 (capitalization omitted), though, to be\\r\\nclear, there is no allegation that Defendants somehow receive Wirecutter\\u2019s lost commission.\\r\\nBarclays Capital forecloses this claim. In that case, the defendant, Fly, was a news\\r\\naggregator that collected and disseminated financial recommendations issued by major financial\\r\\nfirms. 650 F.3d at 882-83. The firms argued that Fly misappropriated \\u201Ctrading\\u2018Recommendations\\u2019\\u201D developed by their analysts through application of \\u201Cexpertise, experience,\\r\\nand judgment.\\u201D Id. at 881. The firms complained \\u201Cthat clients are much more likely to place a\\r\\ntrade with a Firm if they learn of the Recommendation directly from that Firm,\\u201D and that the\\r\\n\\u201Ccommissions on those trades\\u201D are what allowed them to profit from the recommendations. Id.\\r\\nat 882. So they sued under a misappropriation theory.\\r\\nApplying the copyright preemption analysis, the court found that \\u201CRecommendations\\r\\nsatisfy the \\u2018subject matter\\u2019 requirement,\\u201D and that it did not matter that the \\u201Cfacts of the\\r\\nRecommendations themselves are not copyrightable.\\u201D Id. at 902. It then found that the claims\\r\\nimplicated the \\u201Cgeneral scope\\u201D of copyright because they challenged \\u201Cacts of reproduction,\\r\\nperformance, distribution or display.\\u201D Id. And finally, analogizing to hot-news claims, it found\\r\\nthat the firms failed to establish extra elements that would separate a misappropriation claim\\r\\nfrom a copyright claim. Fly was not \\u201Cfree-riding\\u201D because it was not \\u201Cselling the\\r\\nRecommendation \\u2018as its own\\u2019\\u201D\\u2014it was reporting that the firm had made the recommendation.\\r\\nId. at 903. Nor was Fly in \\u201Cdirect competition,\\u201D because nothing indicated diversion of \\u201Ca\\r\\nsignificant portion \\u2026 of [the firms\\u2019 lost] profits.\\u201D Id. at 904.\\r\\nThe analysis applies fully here. Wirecutter recommendations are no less the subject\\r\\nmatter of copyright than the recommendations in Barclays Capital. The Times explicitly alleges\\r\\nharm from \\u201Coffering content \\u2026 that is similar to content published by The Times,\\u201D Compl.\\r\\n\\u00B6 194\\u2014conduct falling within copyright\\u2019s general scope. The Complaint nowhere alleges that\\r\\nDefendants attempt to sell Wirecutter reviews as their own\\u2014on the contrary, The Times\\u2019s\\r\\nexamples of misappropriated referrals all involve prompts asking for Wirecutter reviews. Supra\\r\\n23. And despite the same conclusory claims of competition, the Complaint offers no real-world\\r\\nfacts suggesting meaningful diversion of revenue from Wirecutter to Defendants.Again, courts have not hesitated to find claims like this preempted at the pleading stage.\\r\\nE.g., Gogo Apparel, Inc. v. True Destiny, LLC, No. 19-cv-5693-GBD, 2020 WL 5578336, at *5\\r\\n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2020); Adina\\u2019s Jewels, Inc. v. Shashi, Inc., 442 F. Supp. 3d 766, 772\\r\\n(S.D.N.Y. 2020); Orange Cnty.

NATURE OF THE ACTION\\r\\n1. Independent journalism is vital to our democracy. It is also increasingly rare and\\r\\nvaluable. For more than 170 years, The Times has given the world deeply reported, expert,\\r\\nindependent journalism. Times journalists go where the story is, often at great risk and cost, to\\r\\ninform the public about important and pressing issues. They bear witness to conflict and disasters,\\r\\nprovide accountability for the use of power, and illuminate truths that would otherwise go unseen.\\r\\nTheir essential work is made possible through the efforts of a large and expensive organization\\r\\nthat provides legal, security, and operational support, as well as editors who ensure their journalism\\r\\nmeets the highest standards of accuracy and fairness. This work has always been important. But\\r\\n2\\r\\nwithin a damaged information ecosystem that is awash in unreliable content, The Times\\u2019s\\r\\njournalism provides a service that has grown even more valuable to the public by supplying\\r\\ntrustworthy information, news analysis, and commentary.\\r\\n2. Defendants\\u2019 unlawful use of The Times\\u2019s work to create artificial intelligence\\r\\nproducts that compete with it threatens The Times\\u2019s ability to provide that service. Defendants\\u2019\\r\\ngenerative artificial intelligence (\\u201CGenAI\\u201D) tools rely on large-language models (\\u201CLLMs\\u201D) that\\r\\nwere built by copying and using millions of The Times\\u2019s copyrighted news articles, in-depth\\r\\ninvestigations, opinion pieces, reviews, how-to guides, and more. While Defendants engaged in\\r\\nwidescale copying from many sources, they gave Times content particular emphasis when building\\r\\ntheir LLMs\\u2014revealing a preference that recognizes the value of those works. Through Microsoft\\u2019s\\r\\nBing Chat (recently rebranded as \\u201CCopilot\\u201D) and OpenAI\\u2019s ChatGPT, Defendants seek to free-ride\\r\\non The Times\\u2019s massive investment in its journalism by using it to build substitutive products\\r\\nwithout permission or payment.\\r\\n3. The Constitution and the Copyright Act recognize the critical importance of giving\\r\\ncreators exclusive rights over their works. Since our nation\\u2019s founding, strong copyright protection\\r\\nhas empowered those who gather and report news to secure the fruits of their labor and investment.\\r\\nCopyright law protects The Times\\u2019s expressive, original journalism, including, but not limited to,\\r\\nits millions of articles that have registered copyrights.\\r\\n4. Defendants have refused to recognize this protection. Powered by LLMs containing\\r\\ncopies of Times content, Defendants\\u2019 GenAI tools can generate output that recites Times content\\r\\nverbatim, closely summarizes it, and mimics its expressive style, as demonstrated by scores of\\r\\nexamples. See Exhibit J. These tools also wrongly attribute false information to The Times.\\r\\n3\\r\\n5. Defendants also use Microsoft\\u2019s Bing search index, which copies and categorizes\\r\\nThe Times\\u2019s online content, to generate responses that contain verbatim excerpts and detailed\\r\\nsummaries of Times articles that are significantly longer and more detailed than those returned by\\r\\ntraditional search engines. By providing Times content without The Times\\u2019s permission or\\r\\nauthorization, Defendants\\u2019 tools undermine and damage The Times\\u2019s relationship with its readers\\r\\nand deprive The Times of subscription, licensing, advertising, and affiliate revenue.\\r\\n6. Using the valuable intellectual property of others in these ways without paying for\\r\\nit has been extremely lucrative for Defendants. Microsoft\\u2019s deployment of Times-trained LLMs\\r\\nthroughout its product line helped boost its market capitalization by a trillion dollars in the past\\r\\nyear alone. And OpenAI\\u2019s release of ChatGPT has driven its valuation to as high as $90 billion.\\r\\nDefendants\\u2019 GenAI business interests are deeply intertwined, with Microsoft recently highlighting\\r\\nthat its use of OpenAI\\u2019s \\u201Cbest-in-class frontier models\\u201D has generated customers\\u2014including\\r\\n\\u201Cleading AI startups\\u201D\\u2014for Microsoft\\u2019s Azure AI product.1\\r\\n7. The Times objected after it discovered that Defendants were using Times content\\r\\nwithout permission to develop their models and tools. For months, The Times has attempted to\\r\\nreach a negotiated agreement with Defendants, in accordance with its history of working\\r\\nproductively with large technology platforms to permit the use of its content in new digital\\r\\nproducts (including the news products developed by Google, Meta, and Apple). The Times\\u2019s goal\\r\\nduring these negotiations was to ensure it received fair value for the use of its content, facilitate\\r\\nthe continuation of a healthy news ecosystem, and help develop GenAI technology in a responsible\\r\\nway that benefits society and supports a well-informed public.\\r\\n1 Microsoft Fiscal Year 2024 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call, MICROSOFT INVESTOR RELATIONS\\r\\n(Oct. 24, 2023), https:\\/\\/www.microsoft.com\\/en-us\\/Investor\\/events\\/FY-2024\\/earnings-fy-2024-q1.aspx.\\r\\n4\\r\\n8. These negotiations have not led to a resolution. Publicly, Defendants insist that their\\r\\nconduct is protected as \\u201Cfair use\\u201D because their unlicensed use of copyrighted content to train\\r\\nGenAI models serves a new \\u201Ctransformative\\u201D purpose. But there is nothing \\u201Ctransformative\\u201D about\\r\\nusing The Times\\u2019s content without payment to create products that substitute for The Times and\\r\\nsteal audiences away from it. Because the outputs of Defendants\\u2019 GenAI models compete with and\\r\\nclosely mimic the inputs used to train them, copying Times works for that purpose is not fair use.\\r\\n9. The law does not permit the kind of systematic and competitive infringement that\\r\\nDefendants have committed. This action seeks to hold them responsible for the billions of dollars\\r\\nin statutory and actual damages that they owe for the unlawful copying and use of The Times\\u2019s\\r\\nuniquely valuable works.\\r\\nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\\r\\n10. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \\u00A7\\u00A7 1331 and 1338(a)\\r\\nbecause this action arises under the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 101, et seq.\\r\\n11. Jurisdiction over Microsoft and OpenAI is proper because they have purposely\\r\\navailed themselves of the privilege of conducting business in New York. A substantial portion of\\r\\nMicrosoft and OpenAI\\u2019s widespread infringement and other unlawful conduct alleged herein\\r\\noccurred in New York, including the distribution and sales of Microsoft and OpenAI\\u2019s Generative\\r\\nPre-training Transformer (\\u201CGPT\\u201D)-based products like ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, Bing Chat,\\r\\nAzure OpenAI Service, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and related application programming interface\\r\\n(API) tools within New York to New York residents. Furthermore, both Microsoft and the OpenAI\\r\\nDefendants maintain offices and employ personnel in New York who, upon information and belief,\\r\\nwere involved in the creation, maintenance, or monetization of Microsoft and OpenAI\\u2019s\\r\\nwidespread infringement and other unlawful conduct alleged herein.\\r\\n5\\r\\n12. Because The Times\\u2019s principal place of business and headquarters is in this District,\\r\\nthe injuries alleged herein from Microsoft and OpenAI\\u2019s widespread infringement and other\\r\\nunlawful conduct foreseeably occurred in this District.\\r\\n13. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. \\u00A7 1400(a) because Defendants or their agents\\r\\nreside or may be found in this District, through the infringing and unlawful activities\\u2014as well as\\r\\nDefendants\\u2019 sales and monetization of such activity\\u2014that occurred in this District. Venue is also\\r\\nproper under 28 U.S.C. \\u00A7 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the events giving rise to The\\r\\nTimes\\u2019s claims occurred in this District, including the marketing, sales, and licensing of\\r\\nDefendants\\u2019 GenAI products built on the infringement of The Times\\u2019s intellectual property within\\r\\nthis District. Upon information and belief, OpenAI has sold subscriptions for ChatGPT Plus to\\r\\nNew York residents, and both Microsoft and OpenAI enjoy a substantial base of monthly active\\r\\nusers of Bing Chat and ChatGPT in New York. OpenAI has licensed its GPT models to New York\\r\\nresidents and companies headquartered in New York. For example, this year, OpenAI struck deals\\r\\nto license its GPT models to the Associated Press (AP) and Morgan Stanley, both companies\\r\\nheadquartered in New York.\\r\\nIII. THE PARTIES\\r\\n14. Plaintiff The New York Times Company is a New York corporation with its\\r\\nheadquarters and principal place of business in New York. The Times publishes digital and print\\r\\nproducts, including its core news product, The New York Times, which is available on its mobile\\r\\napplications, on its website (NYTimes.com), and as a printed newspaper, and associated content\\r\\nsuch as its podcasts. The Times also publishes other interest-specific publications, including The\\r\\nAthletic (sports media), Cooking (recipes and other cooking-related content), Games (puzzles and\\r\\n6\\r\\ngames), and Wirecutter (shopping recommendations). The Times owns over 3 million registered,\\r\\ncopyrighted works, including those set forth in Exhibits A\\u2013I, K (\\u201CTimes Works\\u201D).\\r\\n15. Microsoft Corporation is a Washington corporation with a principal place of\\r\\nbusiness and headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft has invested at least $13 billion in\\r\\nOpenAI Global LLC in exchange for which Microsoft will receive 75% of that company\\u2019s profits\\r\\nuntil its investment is repaid, after which Microsoft will own a 49% stake in that company.\\r\\n16. Microsoft has described its relationship with the OpenAI Defendants as a\\r\\n\\u201Cpartnership.\\u201D This partnership has included contributing and operating the cloud computing\\r\\nservices used to copy Times Works and train the OpenAI Defendants\\u2019 GenAI models. It has also\\r\\nincluded, upon information and belief, substantial technical collaboration on the creation of those\\r\\nmodels. Microsoft possesses copies of, or obtains preferential access to, the OpenAI Defendants\\u2019\\r\\nlatest GenAI models that have been trained on and embody unauthorized copies of the Times\\r\\nWorks. Microsoft uses these models to provide infringing content and, at times, misinformation to\\r\\nusers of its products and online services. During a quarterly earnings call in October 2023,\\r\\nMicrosoft noted that \\u201Cmore than 18,000 organizations now use Azure OpenAI Service, including\\r\\nnew-to-Azure customers.\\u201D\\r\\n17.

The New York Times and its Mission\\r\\n1. Almost Two Centuries of High-Quality, Original, Independent News\\r\\n26. The New York Times is a trusted source of quality, independent journalism whose\\r\\nmission is to seek the truth and help people understand the world. Begun as a small, local\\r\\nnewspaper, The Times has evolved to a diversified multi-media company with readers, listeners,\\r\\nand viewers around the globe. Today, more than 10 million subscribers pay for Times journalism,\\r\\n9\\r\\nwhich includes everything from news to opinion, culture to business, cooking to games, and\\r\\nshopping recommendations to sports.\\r\\n27. Founded in 1851, The New York Times has a long history of providing the public\\r\\nwith independent journalism of the highest quality. When Adolph Ochs bought the newspaper out\\r\\nof bankruptcy in 1896, he vowed that The Times would be fiercely independent, dedicated to\\r\\njournalism of the highest integrity, and devoted to the public welfare. He articulated the vision:\\r\\n\\u201CTo give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of any party, sect, or interest\\r\\ninvolved.\\u201D These words still animate The New York Times today, nearly two centuries later.\\r\\n28. Producing original independent journalism is at the heart of this mission. Times\\r\\njournalists cover the most important stories across the globe; in a typical year, The Times sends\\r\\njournalists to report on the ground from more than 160 countries. Together, along with editors,\\r\\nphotographers, audio producers, videographers, graphic designers, data analysts, and more, The\\r\\nTimes\\u2019s newsroom produces groundbreaking journalism across every major storytelling format.\\r\\n29. The quality of The Times\\u2019s coverage has been widely recognized with many\\r\\nindustry and peer accolades, including 135 Pulitzer Prizes since its first Pulitzer award in 1918\\r\\n(nearly twice as many as any other organization). The Times\\u2019s journalism is also deeply impactful.\\r\\nAcademics, teachers, and scientists have used it to educate and innovate. Lawmakers have cited it\\r\\nto introduce legislation. Judges have referenced it in rulings. And tens of millions of people rely\\r\\non it every day.\\r\\n30. Times journalists are experts in their subject matter and among the most\\r\\nexperienced and talented in the industry. In many cases, their work is enhanced by professional\\r\\nexpertise: lawyers cover the court, doctors cover health care, and veterans cover the military. Many\\r\\nTimes journalists draw on decades of experience. One reporter covering the White House, for\\r\\n10\\r\\nexample, has reported on five administrations. His colleague, a White House photographer, has\\r\\ncovered seven.\\r\\n31. In addition to journalists who spend considerable time and effort reporting pieces,\\r\\nThe Times employs hundreds of editors to painstakingly review its journalism for accuracy,\\r\\nindependence, and fairness, with at least two editors reviewing each piece prior to publication and\\r\\nmany more reviewing the most important and sensitive pieces. The Times also has among the\\r\\nlargest and most robust Standards teams in the industry, which advises the newsroom daily on\\r\\nconsistency, accuracy, fairness, and clarity in its reporting and maintains stringent ethical\\r\\nguidelines for journalists and their work. The Times also maintains an internal Stylebook, a\\r\\ndocument that is updated over time to guide the tone of its journalism and the prose used. There is\\r\\nalso an ongoing dialogue among journalists and editors to ensure The Times fairly and thoroughly\\r\\ncovers the right stories and presents what it finds in a clear and compelling way. Producing Times\\r\\njournalism is a creative and deeply human endeavor.\\r\\n2. Groundbreaking, In-Depth Journalism and Breaking News at Great Cost\\r\\n32. To produce world-class journalism, The Times invests an enormous amount of time,\\r\\nmoney, expertise, and talent, both in its newsroom and product, technology, and other supporting\\r\\nteams. Core areas of focus include:\\r\\n33. Investigative Reporting. The Times does deep investigations\\u2014which usually take\\r\\nmonths and sometimes years to report and produce\\u2014into complex and important areas of public\\r\\ninterest. The Times\\u2019s reporters routinely uncover stories that would otherwise never come to light.\\r\\nThey have exposed problems, held power to account, and demanded the public\\u2019s attention. In\\r\\ninvestigating these areas, Times coverage often results in meaningful reforms. These stories are\\r\\n11\\r\\nwritten and edited in the style that is widely associated with The Times, one that readers trust and\\r\\nseek out.\\r\\n34. Breaking News Reporting. The Times is equally committed to quickly and\\r\\naccurately reporting breaking news. In an era in which speculation, disinformation, and spin often\\r\\ndrown out the truth when news breaks, The Times fills an important need for trustworthy news\\r\\nwith journalists who have the subject-matter expertise, news judgment, and sources required to\\r\\nreport the facts in a compelling way. This year, The Times has provided detailed, real-time\\r\\ncoverage on breaking news across a range of topics, including the upcoming U.S. elections,\\r\\nmultiple mass shootings including those in Maine and Nashville, wars in Ukraine and the Middle\\r\\nEast, a spate of natural disasters around the globe, and the collapse of major regional banks.\\r\\n35. Beat Reporting: The Times invests significantly in its beat reporting by giving its\\r\\nbeat reporters the time and space to go deep on a single topic. At The Times, these topics vary from\\r\\npublic health to religion to architecture, and from the Pentagon to Hollywood to Wall Street. They\\r\\nalso include The Times\\u2019s dozens of national and international bureaus, where correspondents are\\r\\nsteeped in the communities they cover. Because this type of journalism is grounded in the expertise\\r\\nand deep connections of Times journalists, beat coverage enriches The Times\\u2019s reporting.\\r\\n36. Reviews and Analysis. The Times is a trusted source for reviews and analysis of\\r\\narts and culture, including food, books, art, film, theater, television, music, fashion, and travel. In\\r\\n2016, it acquired the product review site Wirecutter, which recommends the best products in\\r\\ndozens of categories including home goods, technology, health and fitness, and more. Each year,\\r\\nWirecutter spends tens of thousands of hours conducting rigorous testing and research to produce\\r\\na catalog of reviews that today covers thousands of products.\\r\\n12\\r\\n37. Commentary and Opinion. The Times publishes opinion articles that contribute\\r\\nto public debate across the world. Many of these articles come from The Times\\u2019s staff of world-\\r\\nrenowned columnists. Additionally, leaders in business, politics, religion, education, and the arts\\r\\nwrite guest essays for The Times\\u2019s opinion section, giving readers the opportunity to understand a\\r\\nwide range of experiences, perspectives, and ideas about the most important issues of the day.\\r\\n3. A Commitment to Quality Journalism\\r\\n38. It takes enormous resources to publish, on average, more than 250 original articles\\r\\nevery day. Many of these articles take months\\u2014and sometimes longer\\u2014to report. That output is\\r\\nthe work of approximately 5,800 full-time equivalent Times employees (as of December 31, 2022),\\r\\nsome 2,600 of whom are directly involved in The Times\\u2019s journalism operations.\\r\\n39. Quite often, the most vital news reporting for society is the most resource-intensive.\\r\\nSome of The Times\\u2019s most important journalism requires deploying teams of journalists at great\\r\\ncost to report on the ground around the world, providing best-in-class security and support, filing\\r\\nlawsuits against government entities to bring information to light, and supporting journalists\\r\\nthrough investigations that can take months or years.\\r\\n40. Subscription, advertising, licensing, and affiliate revenue make this reporting\\r\\npossible. In 1996, The Times launched a core news website, alongside its paid print edition, that\\r\\nwas free. As readers shifted from print news to digital products, The Times\\u2014like most print\\r\\npublishers\\u2014faced the prospect of not being able to continue funding its journalism. In response,\\r\\nThe Times reinvented its business model to incorporate digital subscriptions. The Times launched\\r\\nits metered paywall in 2011, in what it called \\u201Ca bet that readers will pay for news they are\\r\\naccustomed to getting free.\\u201D2\\r\\n2 Jeremy W. Peters, The Times Announces Digital Subscription Plan, N.Y. TIMES (Mar. 17, 2011),\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2011\\/03\\/18\\/business\\/media\\/18times.html.\\r\\n13\\r\\n41. Thanks to the quality of The Times\\u2019s journalism, that strategic innovation paid off,\\r\\nwhich allowed The Times to continue to exist and to thrive. Today, the vast majority of subscribers\\r\\nare digital-only. In the 12 years since The Times launched its paywall, it has grown its paid digital\\r\\nsubscribership and developed a direct relationship with its online audience through its tireless\\r\\ncommitment to making journalism \\u201Cworth paying for.\\u201D Generating and maintaining direct traffic\\r\\nto its online content and mobile applications are critical components of The Times\\u2019s financial\\r\\nsuccess.\\r\\n42. By the third quarter of 2023, The Times had nearly 10.1 million digital and print\\r\\nsubscribers worldwide. The Times aims to have 15 million subscribers by year-end 2027.\\r\\n43. The Times makes journalism \\u201Cworth paying for\\u201D by publishing articles that are\\r\\nexhaustively researched and reported, thoughtfully written, carefully edited, and thoroughly fact-\\r\\nchecked.\\r\\n44. In addition, The Times has deepened its relationship with its readers by expanding\\r\\nits offerings to better encompass its readers\\u2019 specific interests, including best-in-class offerings\\r\\nlike Cooking, Wirecutter, Games, and The Athletic.\\r\\n45. The Times\\u2019s paywall does not require payment for all access to The Times\\u2019s\\r\\ncontent. To build audience engagement and loyalty, The Times\\u2019s access model generally offers\\r\\nregistered users free access to a limited number of articles and other content before requiring them\\r\\nto subscribe for access to additional content. Approximately 50 to 100 million users, on average,\\r\\nengage with The Times\\u2019s digital content each week. This traffic is a key source of advertising\\r\\nrevenue and helps drive future subscriptions to The Times.\\r\\n46. The Times also compiled digital archives of all its material going back to its\\r\\nfounding, at significant cost. Its digital archives include The New York Times Article Archive, with\\r\\n14\\r\\npartial and full-text digital versions of articles from 1851 to today, and the TimesMachine, a\\r\\nbrowser-based digital replica of all issues from 1851 to 2002. This represents a singular database\\r\\nof contemporaneous language and information, as well as a unique and valuable historical record.\\r\\nThe Times also provides its own API that allows researchers and academics to search Times\\r\\ncontent for non-commercial purposes.\\r\\n4. GenAI Products Threaten High-Quality Journalism\\r\\n47. Making great journalism is harder than ever. Over the past two decades, the\\r\\ntraditional business models that supported quality journalism have collapsed, forcing the shuttering\\r\\nof newspapers all over the country. It has become more difficult for the public to sort fact from\\r\\nfiction in today\\u2019s information ecosystem, as misinformation floods the internet, television, and\\r\\nother media. If The Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their\\r\\nindependent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill.\\r\\n48. The protection of The Times\\u2019s intellectual property is critical to its continued ability\\r\\nto fund world-class journalism in the public interest. If The Times and its peers cannot control the\\r\\nuse of their content, their ability to monetize that content will be harmed. With less revenue, news\\r\\norganizations will have fewer journalists able to dedicate time and resources to important, in-depth\\r\\nstories, which creates a risk that those stories will go untold. Less journalism will be produced,\\r\\nand the cost to society will be enormous.\\r\\n49. The Times depends on its exclusive rights of reproduction, adaptation, publication,\\r\\nperformance, and display under copyright law to resist these forces. The Times has registered the\\r\\ncopyright in its print edition every day for over 100 years, maintains a paywall, and has\\r\\nimplemented terms of service that set limits on the copying and use of its content. To use Times\\r\\n15\\r\\ncontent for commercial purposes, a party should first approach The Times about a licensing\\r\\nagreement.\\r\\n50. The Times requires third parties to obtain permission before using Times content\\r\\nand trademarks for commercial purposes, and for decades The Times has licensed its content under\\r\\nnegotiated licensing agreements. These agreements help ensure that The Times controls how,\\r\\nwhere, and for how long its content and brand appears and that it receives fair compensation for\\r\\nthird-party use. Third parties, including large tech platforms, pay The Times significant royalties\\r\\nunder these agreements in exchange for the right to use Times content for narrowly defined\\r\\npurposes. The agreements prohibit uses beyond those authorized purposes.\\r\\n51. Times content is also available for licenses for certain uses through the Copyright\\r\\nClearance Center (\\u201CCCC\\u201D), a clearinghouse that licenses material to both corporate and academic\\r\\nusers. Through the CCC, The Times permits limited licenses for instruction, academic, other\\r\\nnonprofit uses, and limited commercial uses. For example, a for-profit business can acquire a CCC\\r\\nlicense to make a photocopy of Times content for internal or external distribution in exchange for\\r\\na licensing fee of about ten dollars per article. A CCC license to post a single Times article on a\\r\\ncommercial website for up to a year costs several thousand dollars.\\r\\n52. The Times\\u2019s ability to continue to attract and grow its digital subscriber base and to\\r\\ngenerate digital advertising revenue depends on the size of The Times\\u2019s audience and users\\u2019\\r\\nsustained engagement directly with The Times\\u2019s websites and mobile applications. To facilitate\\r\\nthis direct engagement with its products, The Times permits search engines to access and index its\\r\\ncontent, which is necessary to allow users to find The Times using these search engines. Inherent\\r\\nin this value exchange is the idea that the search engines will direct users to The Times\\u2019s own\\r\\n16\\r\\nwebsites and mobile applications, rather than exploit The Times\\u2019s content to keep users within\\r\\ntheir own search ecosystem.\\r\\n53. While The Times, like virtually all online publishers, permits search engines to\\r\\naccess its content for the limited purpose of surfacing it in traditional search results, The Times\\r\\nhas never given permission to any entity, including Defendants, to use its content for GenAI\\r\\npurposes.\\r\\n54. The Times reached out to Microsoft and OpenAI in April 2023 to raise intellectual\\r\\nproperty concerns and explore the possibility of an amicable resolution, with commercial terms\\r\\nand technological guardrails that would allow a mutually beneficial value exchange between\\r\\nDefendants and The Times. These efforts have not produced a resolution.\\r\\nB. Defendants\\u2019 GenAI Products\\r\\n1. A Business Model Based on Mass Copyright Infringement\\r\\n55. OpenAI was formed in December 2015 as a \\u201Cnon-profit artificial intelligence\\r\\nresearch company.\\u201D OpenAI started with $1 billion in seed money from its founders, a group of\\r\\nsome of the wealthiest technology entrepreneurs and investors and companies like Amazon Web\\r\\nServices and InfoSys. This group included Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and X Corp. (formerly\\r\\nknown as Twitter); Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn; Sam Altman, the former president\\r\\nof Y Combinator; and Greg Brockman, the former Chief Technology Officer of Stripe.\\r\\n56. Despite accepting very large investments from enormously wealthy companies and\\r\\nindividuals at its founding, OpenAI originally maintained that its research and work would be\\r\\nentirely unmotivated by profit. In a December 11, 2015, press release, Brockman and co-founder\\r\\nIlya Sutskever (now OpenAI\\u2019s President and Chief Scientist, respectively) wrote: \\u201COur goal is to\\r\\nadvance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole,\\r\\n17\\r\\nunconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial\\r\\nobligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact.\\u201D In accordance with that mission,\\r\\nOpenAI promised that its work and intellectual property would be open and available to the public,\\r\\nthat its \\u201C[r]esearchers will be strongly encouraged to publish their work, whether as papers, blog\\r\\nposts, or code\\u201D and that its \\u201Cpatents (if any) will be shared with the world.\\u201D\\r\\n57. Despite its early promises of altruism, OpenAI quickly became a multi-billion-\\r\\ndollar for-profit business built in large part on the unlicensed exploitation of copyrighted works\\r\\nbelonging to The Times and others. Just three years after its founding, OpenAI shed its exclusively\\r\\nnonprofit status. It created OpenAI LP in March 2019, a for-profit company dedicated to\\r\\nconducting the lion\\u2019s share of OpenAI\\u2019s operations\\u2014including product development\\u2014and to\\r\\nraising capital from investors seeking a return. OpenAI\\u2019s corporate structure grew into an intricate\\r\\nweb of for-profit holding, operating, and shell companies that manage OpenAI\\u2019s day-to-day\\r\\noperations and grant OpenAI\\u2019s investors (most prominently, Microsoft) authority and influence\\r\\nover OpenAI\\u2019s operations, all while raising billions in capital from investors. The result: OpenAI\\r\\ntoday is a commercial enterprise valued as high as $90 billion, with revenues projected to be over\\r\\n$1 billion in 2024.\\r\\n58. With the transition to for-profit status came another change: OpenAI also ended its\\r\\ncommitment to openness. OpenAI released the first two iterations of its flagship GenAI model,\\r\\nGPT-1 and GPT-2, on an open-source basis in 2018 and 2019, respectively. But OpenAI changed\\r\\ncourse in 2020, starting with the release of GPT-3 shortly after OpenAI LP and other for-profit\\r\\nOpenAI entities were formed and took control of product design and development.\\r\\n59. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are both orders of magnitude more powerful than the two\\r\\nprevious generations, yet Defendants have kept their design and training entirely a secret. For\\r\\n18\\r\\nprevious generations, OpenAI had voluminous reports detailing the contents of the training set,\\r\\ndesign, and hardware of the LLMs. Not so for GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. For GPT-4, for example, the\\r\\n\\u201Ctechnical report\\u201D that OpenAI released said: \\u201Cthis report contains no further details about the\\r\\narchitecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, dataset construction, training\\r\\nmethod, or similar.\\u201D3\\r\\n60. OpenAI\\u2019s Chief Scientist Sutskever justified this secrecy on commercial grounds:\\r\\n\\u201CIt\\u2019s competitive out there \\u2026. And there are many companies who want to do the same thing, so\\r\\nfrom a competitive side, you can see this as maturation of the field.\\u201D4 But its effect was to conceal\\r\\nthe identity of the data OpenAI copied to train its latest models from rightsholders like The Times.\\r\\n61. OpenAI became a household name upon the release of ChatGPT in November\\r\\n2022. ChatGPT is a text-generating chatbot that, given user-generated prompts, can mimic human-\\r\\nlike natural language responses. ChatGPT was an instant viral sensation, reaching one million\\r\\nusers within a month of its release and gaining over 100 million users within three months.\\r\\n62. OpenAI, through OpenAI OpCo LLC and at the direction of OpenAI Inc., OpenAI\\r\\nLP, and other OpenAI entities, offers a suite of services powered by its LLMs, targeted to both\\r\\nordinary consumers and businesses. A version of ChatGPT powered by GPT-3.5 is available to\\r\\nusers for free. OpenAI also offers a premium service, powered by OpenAI\\u2019s \\u201Cmost capable model\\u201D\\r\\nGPT-4, to consumers for $20 per month. OpenAI\\u2019s business-focused offerings include ChatGPT\\r\\nEnterprise and ChatGPT API tools designed to enable developers to incorporate ChatGPT into\\r\\nbespoke applications. OpenAI also licenses its technology to corporate clients for licensing fees.\\r\\n3 OPENAI, GPT-4 TECHNICAL REPORT (2023), https:\\/\\/cdn.openai.com\\/papers\\/gpt-4.pdf.\\r\\n4 James Vincent, OpenAI Co-Founder on Company\\u2019s Past Approach to Openly Sharing Research: \\u2018We Were\\r\\nWrong\\u2019, THE VERGE (Mar. 15, 2023), https:\\/\\/www.theverge.com\\/2023\\/3\\/15\\/23640180\\/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-\\r\\nresearch-ilya-sutskever-interview.\\r\\n19\\r\\n63. These commercial offerings have been immensely valuable for OpenAI. Over 80%\\r\\nof Fortune 500 companies are using ChatGPT.5 According to recent reports, OpenAI is generating\\r\\nrevenues of $80 million per month, and is on track to surpass over $1 billion within the next 12\\r\\nmonths.6\\r\\n64. This commercial success is built in large part on OpenAI\\u2019s large-scale copyright\\r\\ninfringement. One of the central features driving the use and sales of ChatGPT and its associated\\r\\nproducts is the LLM\\u2019s ability to produce natural language text in a variety of styles. To achieve\\r\\nthis result, OpenAI made numerous reproductions of copyrighted works owned by The Times in\\r\\nthe course of \\u201Ctraining\\u201D the LLM.\\r\\n65. Upon information and belief, all of the OpenAI Defendants have been either\\r\\ndirectly involved in or have directed, controlled, and profited from OpenAI\\u2019s widespread\\r\\ninfringement and commercial exploitation of Times Works. OpenAI Inc., alongside Microsoft,\\r\\ncontrolled and directed the widespread reproduction, distribution, and commercial use of The\\r\\nTimes\\u2019s material perpetrated by OpenAI LP and OpenAI Global LLC, through a series of holding\\r\\nand shell companies that include OpenAI Holdings LLC, OpenAI GP LLC, and OAI Corporation\\r\\nLLC. OpenAI LP and OpenAI Global LLC were directly involved in the design, development, and\\r\\ncommercialization of OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-based products, and directly engaged in the widespread\\r\\nreproduction, distribution, and commercial use of Times Works. OpenAI LP and OpenAI Global\\r\\nLLC also controlled and directed OpenAI, LLC and OpenAI OpCo LLC, which were involved in\\r\\ndistributing, selling, and licensing OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-based products, and thus monetized the\\r\\nreproduction, distribution, and commercial use of Times Works.\\r\\n5 OpenAI, Introducing ChatGPT Enterprise, OPENAI (Aug. 28, 2023),\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/openai.com\\/blog\\/introducing-chatgpt-enterprise.\\r\\n6 Chris Morris, OpenAI Reportedly Nears $1 Billion in Annual Sales, FAST COMPANY (Aug. 30, 2023),\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.fastcompany.com\\/90946849\\/openai-chatgpt-reportedly-nears-1-billion-annual-sales.\\r\\n20\\r\\n66. Since at least 2019, Microsoft has been, and continues to be, intimately involved in\\r\\nthe training, development, and commercialization of OpenAI\\u2019s GPT products. In an interview with\\r\\nthe Wall Street Journal at the 2023 World Economic Forum, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said\\r\\nthat the \\u201CChatGPT and GPT family of models \\u2026 is something that we\\u2019ve been partnered with\\r\\nOpenAI deeply now for multiple years.\\u201D Through this partnership, Microsoft has been involved in\\r\\nthe creation and commercialization of GPT LLMs and products based on them in at least two ways.\\r\\n67. First, Microsoft created and operated bespoke computing systems to execute the\\r\\nmass copyright infringement detailed herein. These systems were used to create multiple\\r\\nreproductions of The Times\\u2019s intellectual property for the purpose of creating the GPT models that\\r\\nexploit and, in many cases, retain large portions of the copyrightable expression contained in those\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n68. Microsoft is the sole cloud computing provider for OpenAI. Microsoft and OpenAI\\r\\ncollaborated to design the supercomputing systems powered by Microsoft\\u2019s cloud computer\\r\\nplatform Azure, which were used to train all OpenAI\\u2019s GPT models after GPT-1. In a July 2023\\r\\nkeynote speech at the Microsoft Inspire conference, Mr. Nadella said: \\u201CWe built the infrastructure\\r\\nto train their models. They\\u2019re innovating on the algorithms and the training of these frontier\\r\\nmodels.\\u201D\\r\\n69. That infrastructure was not just general purpose computer systems for OpenAI to\\r\\nuse as it saw fit. Microsoft specifically designed it for the purpose of using essentially the whole\\r\\ninternet\\u2014curated to disproportionately feature Times Works\\u2014to train the most capable LLM in\\r\\nhistory. In a February 2023 interview, Mr. Nadella said:\\r\\nBut beneath what OpenAI is putting out as large models, remember,\\r\\nthe heavy lifting was done by the [Microsoft] Azure team to build\\r\\nthe computer infrastructure. Because these workloads are so\\r\\ndifferent than anything that\\u2019s come before. So we needed to\\r\\n21\\r\\ncompletely rethink even the datacenter up to the infrastructure that\\r\\nfirst gave us even a shot to build the models. And now we\\u2019re\\r\\ntranslating the models into products.7\\r\\n70. Microsoft built this supercomputer \\u201Cin collaboration with and exclusively for\\r\\nOpenAI,\\u201D and \\u201Cdesigned [it] specifically to train that company\\u2019s AI models.\\u201D8 Even by\\r\\nsupercomputing standards, it was unusually complex. According to Microsoft, it operated as \\u201Ca\\r\\nsingle system with more than 285,000 CPU cores, 10,000 GPUs and 400 gigabits per second of\\r\\nnetwork connectivity for each GPU server.\\u201D This system ranked in the top five most powerful\\r\\npublicly known supercomputing systems in the world.\\r\\n71. To ensure that the supercomputing system suited OpenAI\\u2019s needs, Microsoft\\r\\nneeded to test the system, both independently and in collaboration with OpenAI software\\r\\nengineers. According to Mr. Nadella, with respect to OpenAI: \\u201CThey do the foundation models,\\r\\nand we [Microsoft] do a lot of work around them, including the tooling around responsible AI and\\r\\nAI safety.\\u201D Upon information and belief, such \\u201Ctooling around AI and AI safety\\u201D involves the fine-\\r\\ntuning and calibration of the GPT-based products before their release to the public.9\\r\\n72. In collaboration with OpenAI, Microsoft has also commercialized OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-\\r\\nbased technology, and combined it with its own Bing search index. In February 2023, Microsoft\\r\\nunveiled Bing Chat, a generative AI chatbot feature on its search engine powered by GPT-4. In\\r\\nMay 2023, Microsoft and OpenAI unveiled \\u201CBrowse with Bing,\\u201D a plugin to ChatGPT that enabled\\r\\nit to access the latest content on the internet through the Microsoft Bing search engine. Bing Chat\\r\\n7 First on CNBC: CNBC Transcript: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Speaks with CNBC\\u2019s Jon Fortt on\\r\\n\\u201CPower Lunch\\u201D Today, CNBC (Feb. 7, 2023), https:\\/\\/www.cnbc.com\\/2023\\/02\\/07\\/first-on-cnbc-cnbc-transcript-\\r\\nmicrosoft-ceo-satya-nadella-speaks-with-cnbcs-jon-fortt-on-power-lunch-today.html.\\r\\n8 Jennifer Langston, Microsoft Announces New Supercomputer, Lays Out Vision for Future AI Work,\\r\\nMICROSOFT (May 19, 2020), https:\\/\\/news.microsoft.com\\/source\\/features\\/ai\\/openai-azure-supercomputer\\/.\\r\\n9 S\\u00C9BASTIEN BUBECK ET AL., SPARKS OF ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE: EARLY EXPERIMENTS WITH\\r\\nGPT-4 (2023), https:\\/\\/arxiv.org\\/pdf\\/2303.12712.pdf.\\r\\n22\\r\\nand Browse with Bing combine GPT-4\\u2019s ability to mimic human expression\\u2014including The\\r\\nTimes\\u2019s expression\\u2014with the ability to generate natural language summaries of search result\\r\\ncontents, including hits on Times Works, that obviate the need to visit The Times\\u2019s own websites.\\r\\nThese \\u201Csynthetic\\u201D search results purport to answer user queries directly and may include extensive\\r\\nparaphrases and direct quotes of Times reporting. Such copying maintains engagement with\\r\\nDefendants\\u2019 own sites and applications instead of referring users to The Times in the same way as\\r\\norganic listings of search results.\\r\\n73. In a recent interview, Mr. Nadella acknowledged Microsoft\\u2019s intimate involvement\\r\\nin OpenAI\\u2019s operations and, therefore, its copyright infringement:\\r\\n[W]e were very confident in our own ability. We have all the IP\\r\\nrights and all the capability. If OpenAI disappeared tomorrow, I\\r\\ndon\\u2019t want any customer of ours to be worried about it quite\\r\\nhonestly, because we have all of the rights to continue the\\r\\ninnovation. Not just to serve the product, but we can go and just do\\r\\nwhat we were doing in partnership ourselves. We have the people,\\r\\nwe have the compute, we have the data, we have everything.\\r\\n74. Through their collaboration in both the creation and the commercialization of the\\r\\nGPT models, Defendants have profited from the massive copyright infringement, commercial\\r\\nexploitation, and misappropriation of The Times\\u2019s intellectual property. As Mr. Nadella recently\\r\\nput it, \\u201C[OpenAI] bet on us, we bet on them.\\u201D He continued, describing the effect of Microsoft\\u2019s\\r\\n$13 billion investment:\\r\\nAnd that gives us significant rights as I said. And also this thing, it\\u2019s\\r\\nnot hands off, right? We are in there. We are below them, above\\r\\nthem, around them. We do the kernel optimizations, we build tools,\\r\\nwe build the infrastructure. So that\\u2019s why I think a lot of the\\r\\nindustrial analysts are saying, \\u2018Oh wow, it\\u2019s really a joint project\\r\\nbetween Microsoft and OpenAI.\\u2019 The reality is we are, as I said, very\\r\\nself-sufficient in all of this.\\r\\n23\\r\\n2. How GenAI Models Work\\r\\n75. At the heart of Defendants\\u2019 GenAI products is a computer program called a \\u201Clarge\\r\\nlanguage model,\\u201D or \\u201CLLM.\\u201D The different versions of GPT are examples of LLMs. An LLM\\r\\nworks by predicting words that are likely to follow a given string of text based on the potentially\\r\\nbillions of examples used to train it.\\r\\n76. Appending the output of an LLM to its input and feeding it back into the model\\r\\nproduces sentences and paragraphs word by word. This is how ChatGPT and Bing Chat generate\\r\\nresponses to user queries, or \\u201Cprompts.\\u201D\\r\\n77. LLMs encode the information from the training corpus that they use to make these\\r\\npredictions as numbers called \\u201Cparameters.\\u201D There are approximately 1.76 trillion parameters in\\r\\nthe GPT-4 LLM.\\r\\n78. The process of setting the values for an LLM\\u2019s parameters is called \\u201Ctraining.\\u201D It\\r\\ninvolves storing encoded copies of the training works in computer memory, repeatedly passing\\r\\nthem through the model with words masked out, and adjusting the parameters to minimize the\\r\\ndifference between the masked-out words and the words that the model predicts to fill them in.\\r\\n79. After being trained on a general corpus, models may be further subject to \\u201Cfine-\\r\\ntuning\\u201D by, for example, performing additional rounds of training using specific types of works to\\r\\nbetter mimic their content or style, or providing them with human feedback to reinforce desired or\\r\\nsuppress undesired behaviors.\\r\\n80. Models trained in this way are known to exhibit a behavior called\\r\\n\\u201Cmemorization.\\u201D10 That is, given the right prompt, they will repeat large portions of materials they\\r\\n10 GERRIT J.J. VAN DEN BURG & CHRISTOPHER K.I. WILLIAMS, ON MEMORIZATION IN PROBABILISTIC DEEP\\r\\nGENERATIVE MODELS (2021), https:\\/\\/proceedings.neurips.cc\\/paper\\/2021\\/file\\/eae15aabaa768ae4a5993a8a4f4fa6e4-\\r\\nPaper.pdf.\\r\\n24\\r\\nwere trained on. This phenomenon shows that LLM parameters encode retrievable copies of many\\r\\nof those training works.\\r\\n81. Once trained, LLMs may be provided with information specific to a use case or\\r\\nsubject matter in order to \\u201Cground\\u201D their outputs. For example, an LLM may be asked to generate\\r\\na text output based on specific external data, such as a document, provided as context. Using this\\r\\nmethod, Defendants\\u2019 synthetic search applications: (1) receive an input, such as a question; (2)\\r\\nretrieve relevant documents related to the input prior to generating a response; (3) combine the\\r\\noriginal input with the retrieved documents in order to provide context; and (4) provide the\\r\\ncombined data to an LLM, which generates a natural-language response.11 As shown below, search\\r\\nresults generated in this way may extensively copy or closely paraphrase works that the models\\r\\nthemselves may not have memorized.\\r\\nC. Defendants\\u2019 Unauthorized Use and Copying of Times Content\\r\\n82. Microsoft and OpenAI created and distributed reproductions of The Times\\u2019s\\r\\ncontent in several, independent ways in the course of training their LLMs and operating the\\r\\nproducts that incorporate them.\\r\\n1. Unauthorized Reproduction of Times Works During GPT Model Training\\r\\n83. Defendants\\u2019 GPT models are a family of LLMs, the first of which was introduced\\r\\nin 2018, followed by GPT-2 in 2019, GPT-3 in 2020, GPT-3.5 in 2022, and GPT-4 in 2023. The\\r\\n\\u201Cchat\\u201D style LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, were developed in two stages. First, a transformer model\\r\\nwas pre-trained on a very large amount of data. Second, the model was \\u201Cfine-tuned\\u201D on a much\\r\\nsmaller supervised dataset in order to help the model solve specific tasks.\\r\\n11 Ben Ufuk Tezcan, How We Interact with Information: The New Era of Search, MICROSOFT (Sept. 19,\\r\\n2023), https:\\/\\/azure.microsoft.com\\/en-us\\/blog\\/how-we-interact-with-information-the-new-era-of-search\\/.\\r\\n25\\r\\n84. The pre-training step involved collecting and storing text content to create training\\r\\ndatasets and processing that content through the GPT models. While OpenAI did not release the\\r\\ntrained versions of GPT-2 onward, \\u201C[d]ue to [OpenAI\\u2019s] concerns about malicious applications of\\r\\nthe technology,\\u201D OpenAI has published general information about its pre-training process for the\\r\\nGPT models.12\\r\\n85. GPT-2 includes 1.5 billion parameters, which was a 10X scale up of GPT.13 The\\r\\ntraining dataset for GPT-2 includes an internal corpus OpenAI built called \\u201CWebText,\\u201D which\\r\\nincludes \\u201Cthe text contents of 45 million links posted by users of the \\u2018Reddit\\u2019 social network.\\u201D14\\r\\nThe contents of the WebText dataset were created as a \\u201Cnew web scrape which emphasizes\\r\\ndocument quality.\\u201D15 The WebText dataset contains a staggering amount of scraped content from\\r\\nThe Times. For example, the NYTimes.com domain is one of the \\u201Ctop 15 domains by volume\\u201D in\\r\\nthe WebText dataset,16 and is listed as the 5th \\u201Ctop domain\\u201D in the WebText dataset with 333,160\\r\\nentries.17\\r\\n12 OpenAI, Better Language Models and Their Implications, OPENAI (Feb. 14, 2019),\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/openai.com\\/research\\/better-language-models.\\r\\n13 Id.\\r\\n14 GPT-2 Model Card, GITHUB (Nov. 2019), https:\\/\\/github.com\\/openai\\/gpt-2\\/blob\\/master\\/model_card.md.\\r\\n15 RADFORD ET AL., LANGUAGE MODELS ARE UNSUPERVISED MULTITASK LEARNERS 3 (2018),\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net\\/better-language-models\\/language-models.pdf.\\r\\n16 GPT-2 Model Card, supra note 14.\\r\\n17 GPT-2 \\/ domains.txt, GITHUB, https:\\/\\/github.com\\/openai\\/gpt-2\\/blob\\/master\\/domains.txt (last visited Dec.\\r\\n21, 2023).\\r\\n26\\r\\n86. GPT-3 includes 175 billion parameters and was trained on the datasets listed in the\\r\\ntable below.18\\r\\n87. One of these datasets, WebText2, was created to prioritize high value content. Like\\r\\nthe original WebText, it is composed of popular outbound links from Reddit. As shown in the table\\r\\nabove, the WebText2 corpus was weighted 22% in the training mix for GPT-3 despite constituting\\r\\nless than 4% of the total tokens in the training mix. Times content\\u2014a total of 209,707 unique\\r\\nURLs\\u2014accounts for 1.23% of all sources listed in OpenWebText2, an open-source re-creation of\\r\\nthe WebText2 dataset used in training GPT-3. Like the original WebText, OpenAI describes\\r\\nWebText2 as a \\u201Chigh-quality\\u201D dataset that is \\u201Can expanded version of the WebText dataset \\u2026\\r\\ncollected by scraping links over a longer period of time.\\u201D19\\r\\n88. The most highly weighted dataset in GPT-3, Common Crawl, is a \\u201Ccopy of the\\r\\nInternet\\u201D made available by an eponymous 501(c)(3) organization run by wealthy venture capital\\r\\ninvestors.20 The domain www.nytimes.com is the most highly represented proprietary source (and\\r\\nthe third overall behind only Wikipedia and a database of U.S. patent documents) represented in a\\r\\n18 BROWN ET AL., LANGUAGE MODELS ARE FEW-SHOT LEARNERS 9 (2020),\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/arxiv.org\\/pdf\\/2005.14165.pdf.\\r\\n19 Id. at 8.\\r\\n20 COMMON CRAWL, https:\\/\\/commoncrawl.org\\/ (last visited Dec. 21, 2023).\\r\\n27\\r\\nfiltered English-language subset of a 2019 snapshot of Common Crawl, accounting for 100 million\\r\\ntokens (basic units of text):21\\r\\n89. The Common Crawl dataset includes at least 16 million unique records of content\\r\\nfrom The Times across News, Cooking, Wirecutter, and The Athletic, and more than 66 million\\r\\ntotal records of content from The Times.\\r\\n90. Critically, OpenAI admits that \\u201Cdatasets we view as higher-quality are sampled\\r\\nmore frequently\\u201D during training.22 Accordingly, by OpenAI\\u2019s own admission, high-quality\\r\\ncontent, including content from The Times, was more important and valuable for training the GPT\\r\\nmodels as compared to content taken from other, lower-quality sources.\\r\\n21 DODGE ET AL., DOCUMENTING LARGE WEBTEXT CORPORA: A CASE STUDY ON THE COLOSSAL CLEAN\\r\\nCRAWLED CORPUS (2021), https:\\/\\/arxiv.org\\/abs\\/2104.08758.\\r\\n22 BROWN ET AL., supra note 18.\\r\\n5 most represented top-level domains (left) and websites (right) in C4.

We discuss\\r\\nthe implications of this in \\u00A74.1.\\r\\nTwo well-represented domains of text are\\r\\nWikipedia and news (NYTimes, LATimes, Al-\\r\\nJazeera, etc.). These have been extensively used in\\r\\n28\\r\\n91. While OpenAI has not released much information about GPT-4, experts suspect\\r\\nthat GPT-4 includes 1.8 trillion parameters, which is over 10X larger than GPT-3, and was trained\\r\\non approximately 13 trillion tokens.23 The training set for GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 was\\r\\ncomprised of 45 terabytes of data\\u2014the equivalent of a Microsoft Word document that is over 3.7\\r\\nbillion pages long.24 Between the Common Crawl, WebText, and WebText2 datasets, the\\r\\nDefendants likely used millions of Times-owned works in full in order to train the GPT models.\\r\\n92. Defendants repeatedly copied this mass of Times copyrighted content, without any\\r\\nlicense or other compensation to The Times. As part of training the GPT models, Microsoft and\\r\\nOpenAI collaborated to develop a complex, bespoke supercomputing system to house and\\r\\nreproduce copies of the training dataset, including copies of The Times-owned content. Millions\\r\\nof Times Works were copied and ingested\\u2014multiple times\\u2014for the purpose of \\u201Ctraining\\u201D\\r\\nDefendants\\u2019 GPT models.\\r\\n93. Upon information and belief, Microsoft and OpenAI acted jointly in the large-scale\\r\\ncopying of The Times\\u2019s material involved in generating the GPT models programmed to accurately\\r\\nmimic The Times\\u2019s content and writers. Microsoft and OpenAI collaborated in designing the GPT\\r\\nmodels, selecting the training datasets, and supervising the training process. As Mr. Nadella stated:\\r\\nSo, there are a lot of, I call it, product design choices one gets to\\r\\nmake when you think about AI and AI safety. Then, let\\u2019s come at it\\r\\nthe other way. You have to take real care of the pretrained data\\r\\nbecause models are trained on pretrained data. What\\u2019s the quality,\\r\\nthe provenance of that pretrained data? That\\u2019s a place where we\\u2019ve\\r\\ndone a lot of work.25\\r\\n23 Maximilian Schreiner, GPT-4 Architecture, Datasets, Costs and More Leaked, THE DECODER (July 11,\\r\\n2023), https:\\/\\/the-decoder.com\\/gpt-4-architecture-datasets-costs-and-more-leaked\\/.\\r\\n24 Kindra Cooper, OpenAI GPT-3: Everything You Need to Know [Updated], SPRINGBOARD (Sept. 27,\\r\\n2023), https:\\/\\/www.springboard.com\\/blog\\/data-science\\/machine-learning-gpt-3-open-ai\\/.\\r\\n25 Nilay Patel, Microsoft Thinks AI Can Beat Google at Search \\u2014 CEO Satya Nadella Explains Why, THE\\r\\nVERGE (Feb. 7, 2023), https:\\/\\/www.theverge.com\\/23589994\\/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-bing-chatgpt-google-\\r\\nsearch-ai.\\r\\n29\\r\\n94. To the extent that Microsoft did not select the works used to train the GPT models,\\r\\nit acted in self-described \\u201Cpartnership\\u201D with OpenAI respecting that selection, knew or was\\r\\nwillfully blind to the identity of the selected works by virtue of its knowledge of the nature and\\r\\nidentity of the training corpuses and selection criteria employed by OpenAI, and\\/or had the right\\r\\nand ability to prevent OpenAI from using any particular work for training by virtue of its physical\\r\\ncontrol of the supercomputer it developed for that purpose and its legal and financial influence\\r\\nover the OpenAI Defendants.\\r\\n95. Upon information and belief, Microsoft and OpenAI continue to create\\r\\nunauthorized copies of Times Works in the form of synthetic search results returned by their Bing\\r\\nChat and Browse with Bing products. Microsoft actively gathers copies of the Times Works used\\r\\nto generate such results in the process of crawling the web to create the index for its Bing search\\r\\nengine.\\r\\n96. On information and belief, Microsoft and OpenAI are currently or will imminently\\r\\ncommence making additional copies of Times Works to train and\\/or fine-tune the next-generation\\r\\nGPT-5 LLM.\\r\\n97. Defendants\\u2019 large-scale commercial exploitation of Times content is not licensed,\\r\\nnor have Defendants received permission from The Times to copy and use its works to build their\\r\\nGenAI tools.\\r\\n2. Embodiment of Unauthorized Reproductions and Derivatives of Times Works in\\r\\nGPT Models\\r\\n98. As further evidence of being trained using unauthorized copies of Times Works, the\\r\\nGPT LLMs themselves have \\u201Cmemorized\\u201D copies of many of those same works encoded into their\\r\\nparameters. As shown below and in Exhibit J, the current GPT-4 LLM will output near-verbatim\\r\\n30\\r\\ncopies of significant portions of Times Works when prompted to do so. Such memorized examples\\r\\nconstitute unauthorized copies or derivative works of the Times Works used to train the model.\\r\\n99. For example, in 2019, The Times published a Pulitzer-prize winning, five-part\\r\\nseries on predatory lending in New York City\\u2019s taxi industry. The 18-month investigation included\\r\\n600 interviews, more than 100 records requests, large-scale data analysis, and the review of\\r\\nthousands of pages of internal bank records and other documents, and ultimately led to criminal\\r\\nprobes and the enactment of new laws to prevent future abuse. OpenAI had no role in the creation\\r\\nof this content, yet with minimal prompting, will recite large portions of it verbatim:26\\r\\n26 For original article, see Brian M. Rosenthal, As Thousands of Taxi Drivers Were Trapped in Loans, Top\\r\\nOfficials Counted the Money, N.Y. TIMES (May 19, 2019), https:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2019\\/05\\/19\\/nyregion\\/taxi-\\r\\nmedallions.html.\\r\\n31\\r\\nExhibit J at 5.\\r\\n100. Similarly, in 2012, The Times published a groundbreaking series examining how\\r\\noutsourcing by Apple and other technology companies transformed the global economy. The series\\r\\nwas the product of an enormous effort across three continents. Reporting this story was especially\\r\\nchallenging because The Times was repeatedly denied both interviews and access. The Times\\r\\ncontacted hundreds of current and former Apple executives, and ultimately secured information\\r\\nfrom more than six dozen Apple insiders. Again, GPT-4 copied this content and can recite large\\r\\nportions of it verbatim:27\\r\\n27 For original article, see Charles Duhigg & Keith Bradsher, How the U.S. Lost Out on iPhone Work, N.Y.\\r\\nTIMES (Jan. 21, 2012), https:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2012\\/01\\/22\\/business\\/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-\\r\\nclass.html.\\r\\n32\\r\\nExhibit J at 3.\\r\\n101. Exhibit J provides scores of additional examples of memorization of Times Works\\r\\nby GPT-4. Upon information and belief, these examples represent a small fraction of Times Works\\r\\nwhose expressive contents have been substantially encoded within the parameters of the GPT\\r\\nseries of LLMs. Each of those LLMs thus embodies many unauthorized copies or derivatives of\\r\\nTimes Works.\\r\\n3. Unauthorized Public Display of Times Works in GPT Product Outputs\\r\\n102. Defendants directly engaged in the unauthorized public display of Times Works as\\r\\npart of generative output provided by their products built on the GPT models. Defendants\\u2019\\r\\ncommercial applications built using GPT models include, inter alia, ChatGPT (including its\\r\\nassociated offerings, ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Enterprise, and Browse with Bing), Bing Chat, and\\r\\nthe Microsoft 365 Copilot line of digital assistants. These products display Times content in\\r\\ngenerative output in at least two ways: (1) by showing \\u201Cmemorized\\u201D copies or derivatives of Times\\r\\nWorks retrieved from the models themselves, and (2) by showing synthetic search results that are\\r\\nsubstantially similar to Times Works generated from copies stored in Bing\\u2019s search index.\\r\\n33\\r\\n103. For example, ChatGPT displays copies or derivatives of Times Works memorized\\r\\nby the underlying GPT models in response to user prompts. Upon information and belief, the\\r\\nunderlying GPT models for ChatGPT must have been trained on these and countless other Times\\r\\nWorks to be able to generate such expansive summaries and verbatim text.\\r\\n104. Below, ChatGPT quotes part of the 2012 Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times\\r\\narticle \\u201CSnow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek,\\u201D which was generated in response to a prompt\\r\\ncomplaining about being \\u201Cpaywalled out\\u201D of the article:28\\r\\n28 For original article, see John Branch, Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek, N.Y.

The above output from ChatGPT includes verbatim excerpts from the original\\r\\narticle.

Gravity did the rest.\\r\\nSnow shattered and spilled down the slope. Within seconds, the\\r\\navalanche was the size of more than a thousand cars barreling down\\r\\nthe mountain and weighed millions of pounds.

Below, ChatGPT purports to quote former Times restaurant critic Pete Wells\\u2019s 2012\\r\\nreview of Guy Fieri\\u2019s American Kitchen & Bar, an article that has been described as a viral\\r\\nsensation:29\\r\\n29 For original article, see Pete Wells, As Not Seen on TV, N.Y.

The above output from ChatGPT includes verbatim excerpts from the original\\r\\narticle. The copied article text is highlighted in red below:\\r\\nGUY FIERI, have you eaten at your new restaurant in Times\\r\\nSquare? Have you pulled up one of the 500 seats at Guy\\u2019s American\\r\\nKitchen & Bar and ordered a meal? Did you eat the food?

Unauthorized Retrieval and Dissemination of Current News\\r\\n108. Synthetic search applications built on the GPT LLMs, including Bing Chat and\\r\\nBrowse with Bing for ChatGPT, display extensive excerpts or paraphrases of the contents of search\\r\\nresults, including Times content, that may not have been included in the model\\u2019s training set. The\\r\\n\\u201Cgrounding\\u201D technique employed by these products includes receiving a prompt from a user,\\r\\ncopying Times content relating to the prompt from the internet, providing the prompt together with\\r\\nthe copied Times content as additional context for the LLM, and having the LLM stitch together\\r\\nparaphrases or quotes from the copied Times content to create natural-language substitutes that\\r\\nserve the same informative purpose as the original. In some cases, Defendants\\u2019 models simply spit\\r\\nout several paragraphs of The Times\\u2019s articles.\\r\\n109. The contents of such synthetic responses often go far beyond the snippets typically\\r\\nshown with ordinary search results. Even when synthetic search responses include links to source\\r\\nmaterials, users have less need to navigate to those sources because their expressive content is\\r\\nalready quoted or paraphrased in the narrative result. Indeed, such indication of attribution may\\r\\nmake users more likely to trust the summary alone and not click through to verify.\\r\\n38\\r\\n110. In this way, synthetic search results divert important traffic away from copyright\\r\\nholders like The Times. A user who has already read the latest news or found the right kind of\\r\\nproduct, even\\u2014or especially\\u2014with attribution to The New York Times, has less reason to visit the\\r\\noriginal source.\\r\\n111. Below are a few illustrative and non-exhaustive examples of synthetic search\\r\\nresults from Bing Chat and ChatGPT\\u2019s Browse with Bing.\\r\\na) Examples of Synthetic Search Results from Bing Chat\\r\\n112.

The copied article text is highlighted in red\\r\\nbelow.\\r\\nFor days after Emine Yilmaz Ozsoy was shoved against a speeding\\r\\nsubway train on her way to work, she lay in intensive care at\\r\\nNewYork-Presbyterian\\/Weill Cornell Medical Center. She\\r\\nunderwent two surgeries, her body so violently battered that she was\\r\\nunder constant watch for fear that her traumatized arteries would\\r\\nfail her.\\r\\nOn Thursday, Ms. Ozsoy remained partially paralyzed, but was\\r\\ngathering strength, testing her remaining mobility and cognizant of\\r\\neverything that had happened to her since early Sunday morning\\r\\nwhen a man thrust her head into the train as it pulled out of the\\r\\nLexington Avenue\\/63rd Street station.\\r\\n\\u201CAt this moment, her journey is a very scary journey,\\u201D her husband,\\r\\nFerdi Ozsoy, said in an interview.\\r\\n120. The synthetic output displays significantly more expressive content from the\\r\\noriginal article than what would traditionally be displayed in a Bing search result for the same\\r\\narticle as shown below. Unlike a traditional search result, the synthetic output also does not include\\r\\na prominent hyperlink that sends users to The Times\\u2019s website.\\r\\n45\\r\\n121. This example likewise shows Browse with Bing for ChatGPT reproducing the first\\r\\ntwo paragraphs of The New York Times article \\u201CAre the Hamptons Still Hip?\\u201D from May 2023.34\\r\\n34 For original article, see Anna Kod\\u00E9, Are the Hamptons Still Hip?, N.Y. TIMES (May 26, 2023),\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2023\\/05\\/26\\/realestate\\/hamptons-summer-housing-costs.html.\\r\\n46\\r\\n122. The above synthetic output from ChatGPT with the Browse with Bing plugin\\r\\nincludes verbatim excerpts from the original article. The copied article text is highlighted in red\\r\\nbelow.\\r\\nFor years, the Hamptons were a hot summer destination for young,\\r\\nup-and-coming New Yorkers and the old and new moneyed alike. It\\r\\nwas a place to see and be seen. Stories of Mick Jagger partying in\\r\\nMontauk spread like lore, and Andy Warhol once hosted the Rolling\\r\\nStones at his beachfront compound. It wasn\\u2019t uncommon for young\\r\\ncollege graduates in the city to save up and pool together to rent a\\r\\nsummer house and get a taste of the glamour.\\r\\nIn a 1999 interview with New York Magazine, Jay-Z put it simply:\\r\\n\\u201CI mean, the Hamptons is cool.\\u201D\\r\\nThe Hamptons still have a mythological reputation, fueled by the\\r\\ncelebrity cachet that comes with square footage, seclusion and ocean\\r\\nwaves. \\u201CKaia Gerber, Ina Garten and Diplo walk into a bar \\u2014 that\\r\\nis to say, the Hamptons holds a certain, je ne sais quoi? Where else\\r\\nwould these mega names be in the same sentence?\\u201D said Jacob\\r\\nRutledge, a 22-year-old model and content creator.\\r\\nBut the Hamptons are not what they once were. A slew of factors \\u2014\\r\\nextremely expensive housing costs (high even for the Hamptons),\\r\\nstrict rules around how many people can share a home, a crackdown\\r\\non nightlife and the pandemic fueling more people with children to\\r\\nlive there year round \\u2014 combined to make the summer resort less\\r\\ndesirable among everyday 20- and 30-somethings.\\r\\nDespite his instinct to marvel at the Long Island refuge, Mr.\\r\\nRutledge, who lives in Ridgewood, Queens, isn\\u2019t going out to the\\r\\nHamptons this summer. Instead, he\\u2019ll be close by at Fire Island.\\r\\n123. Again, the synthetic output displays significantly more expressive content from the\\r\\noriginal article than what would traditionally be displayed in a Bing search result for the same\\r\\narticle, as shown below. Unlike a traditional search result, the synthetic output also does not include\\r\\na prominent hyperlink that sends users to The Times\\u2019s website.\\r\\n47\\r\\n5. Willful Infringement\\r\\n124. Defendants\\u2019 unauthorized reproduction and display of Times Works is willful.\\r\\nDefendants were intimately involved in training, fine-tuning, and otherwise testing the GPT\\r\\nmodels. Defendants knew or should have known that these actions involved unauthorized copying\\r\\nof Times Works on a massive scale during training, resulted in the unauthorized encoding of huge\\r\\nnumbers of such works in the models themselves, and would inevitably result in the unauthorized\\r\\ndisplay of such works that the models had either memorized or would present to users in the form\\r\\nof synthetic search results. In fact, in late 2023 before his ouster and subsequent reinstatement as\\r\\nOpenAI\\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman reportedly clashed with OpenAI board member Helen Toner over a\\r\\npaper that Toner wrote criticizing the company over \\u201Csafety and ethics issues related to the\\r\\nlaunches of ChatGPT and GPT-4, including regarding copyright issues.\\u201D\\r\\n125. The Times specifically put Defendants on notice that these uses of Times Works\\r\\nwere not authorized by placing copyright notices and linking to its terms of service (which contain,\\r\\namong other things, terms and conditions for the use of its works) on every page of its websites\\r\\nwhose contents Defendants copied and displayed. Upon information and belief, Defendants\\r\\nintentionally removed such copyright management information (\\u201CCMI\\u201D) from Times Works in the\\r\\nprocess of preparing them to be used to train their models with the knowledge that such CMI would\\r\\n48\\r\\nnot be retained within the models or displayed when the models present unauthorized copies or\\r\\nderivatives of Times Works to users, and thereby facilitate or conceal their infringement.\\r\\n126. Upon information and belief, Defendants were aware of many examples of\\r\\ncopyright infringement after ChatGPT, Browse with Bing, and Bing Chat were released, some of\\r\\nwhich were widely publicized. In fact, after the release of ChatGPT and Bing Chat, The Times\\r\\nreached out to Defendants to inform them that their tools infringed its copyrighted works.\\r\\nD. Misappropriation of Commercial Referrals\\r\\n127. In addition to their reproduction of Times news media, both Bing Chat and Browse\\r\\nwith Bing for ChatGPT also display extensive excerpts or paraphrases of Wirecutter content when\\r\\nprompted. As shown below, the contents of these synthetic responses go beyond ordinary search\\r\\nresults, often fully reproducing Wirecutter\\u2019s recommendations for particular items and their\\r\\nunderlying rationale.\\r\\n128. Wirecutter generates the vast majority of its revenue via affiliate referral.\\r\\nWirecutter\\u2019s journalists, acting with full editorial independence and integrity, spend tens of\\r\\nthousands of hours each year researching and testing products to ensure that they recommend only\\r\\nthe best. Those recommendations, when presented to Wirecutter\\u2019s readers, include direct links to\\r\\nmerchants, who in turn often give Wirecutter a portion of the sale price upon completion of a\\r\\ntransaction. That is, when a user purchases a Wirecutter-recommended product through the link in\\r\\na Wirecutter article, Wirecutter generally earns a commission on the sale. Wirecutter does not\\r\\nreceive affiliate referral revenue if a user purchases the Wirecutter-recommended product through\\r\\na link on Defendants\\u2019 platforms. As with The Times\\u2019s other products, decreases in traffic to\\r\\nWirecutter also impact its advertising and subscription revenue.\\r\\n49\\r\\n129. Detailed synthetic search results that effectively reproduce Wirecutter\\r\\nrecommendations create less incentive for users to navigate to the original source. Decreased\\r\\ntraffic to Wirecutter articles, and in turn, decreased traffic to affiliate links, subsequently lead to a\\r\\nloss of revenue for Wirecutter. A user who already knows Wirecutter\\u2019s recommendations for the\\r\\nbest cordless stick vacuum, and the basis for those recommendations, has little reason to visit the\\r\\noriginal Wirecutter article and click on the links within its site. In this way, Defendants\\u2019 generative\\r\\nAI products directly and unfairly compete with Times content and usurp commercial opportunities\\r\\nfrom The Times.\\r\\n130. For example, Browse with Bing was able to reproduce Wirecutter\\u2019s picks for the\\r\\nbest kitchen scale, accurately summarizing all four of Wirecutter\\u2019s recommendations and\\r\\nexplaining its picks through substantial verbatim copying from the Wirecutter article. When asked\\r\\nto reproduce the article\\u2019s first sentence, Browse with Bing did so accurately:\\r\\n50\\r\\n131. Bing Chat produced a similar response when asked about Wirecutter\\u2019s 2023 article\\r\\non the best cordless stick vacuum, correctly citing all three of the vacuums that Wirecutter\\r\\nrecommended and reproducing the article\\u2019s first paragraph with substantial direct copying:\\r\\n51\\r\\n132. As in the examples of copied news content above, these synthetic outputs display\\r\\nsignificantly more expressive content from the original Wirecutter article than what would\\r\\ntraditionally be displayed in a search result for the same article. Unlike a traditional search result,\\r\\nthe synthetic output also does not include a prominent hyperlink that sends users to Wirecutter\\u2019s\\r\\nwebsite.\\r\\n133. Users rely on Wirecutter for high-quality, well-researched recommendations, and\\r\\nWirecutter\\u2019s brand is damaged by incidents that erode consumer trust and fuel a perception that\\r\\nWirecutter\\u2019s recommendations are unreliable.\\r\\n134. In response to a query regarding Wirecutter\\u2019s recommendations for the best office\\r\\nchair, GPT-4 not only reproduced the top four Wirecutter recommendations, but it also\\r\\nrecommended the \\u201CLa-Z-Boy Trafford Big & Tall Executive Chair\\u201D and the \\u201CFully Balans\\r\\nChair\\u201D\\u2014neither of which appears in Wirecutter\\u2019s recommendations\\u2014and falsely attributed these\\r\\nrecommendations to Wirecutter:\\r\\n52\\r\\n135. As discussed in more detail below, this \\u201Challucination\\u201D endangers Wirecutter\\u2019s\\r\\nreputation by falsely attributing a product recommendation to Wirecutter that it did not make and\\r\\ndid not confirm as being a sound product.\\r\\nE. \\u201CHallucinations\\u201D Falsely Attributed to The Times\\r\\n136. At the same time as Defendants\\u2019 models are copying, reproducing, and\\r\\nparaphrasing Times content without consent or compensation, they are also causing The Times\\r\\ncommercial and competitive injury by misattributing content to The Times that it did not, in fact,\\r\\npublish. In AI parlance, this is called a \\u201Challucination.\\u201D In plain English, it\\u2019s misinformation.\\r\\n137. ChatGPT defines a \\u201Challucination\\u201D as \\u201Cthe phenomenon of a machine, such as a\\r\\nchatbot, generating seemingly realistic sensory experiences that do not correspond to any real-\\r\\nworld input.\\u201D35 Instead of saying, \\u201CI don\\u2019t know,\\u201D Defendants\\u2019 GPT models will confidently\\r\\nprovide information that is, at best, not quite accurate and, at worst, demonstrably (but not\\r\\nrecognizably) false. And human reviewers find it very difficult to distinguish \\u201Challucinations\\u201D from\\r\\ntruthful output.\\r\\n138. For example, in response to a query requesting the sixth paragraph of a New York\\r\\nTimes article titled \\u201CInside Amazon \\u2013 Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace,\\u201D Bing Chat\\r\\nconfidently purported to reproduce the sixth paragraph. Had Bing Chat actually done so, it would\\r\\n35 Hussam Alkaissi & Samy I McFarlan, Artificial Hallucinations in ChatGPT: Implications in Scientific\\r\\nWriting, CUREUS (Feb. 19, 2023), ehttps:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC9939079\\/.\\r\\n53\\r\\nhave committed copyright infringement. But in this instance, Bing Chat completely fabricated a\\r\\nparagraph, including specific quotes attributed to Steve Forbes\\u2019s daughter Moira Forbes, that\\r\\nappear nowhere in The Times article in question or anywhere else on the internet.\\r\\n139. In response to a query seeking what The New York Times said are \\u201Cthe 15 most\\r\\nheart-healthy foods to eat\\u201D in a specific, linked New York Times article titled, \\u201CA Heart-Healthy\\r\\nWay to Eat,\\u201D Bing Chat identified 15 heart-healthy foods \\u201C[a]ccording to the article you provided\\u201D\\r\\nincluding \\u201Cred wine (in moderation).\\u201D In fact, The Times article did not provide a list of heart-\\r\\nhealthy foods and did not even mention 12 of the 15 foods identified by Bing Chat (including red\\r\\nwine).36\\r\\n36 In fact, The Times\\u2019s latest reporting concludes that red wine is not heart-healthy.

In response to a prompt requesting an informative essay about major newspapers\\u2019\\r\\nreporting that orange juice is linked to non-Hodgkin\\u2019s lymphoma, a GPT model completely\\r\\nfabricated that \\u201CThe New York Times published an article on January 10, 2020, titled \\u2018Study Finds\\r\\nPossible Link between Orange Juice and Non-Hodgkin\\u2019s Lymphoma.\\u2019\\u201D The Times never\\r\\npublished such an article.\\r\\n55\\r\\n141. In response to a query asking for New York Times articles about the Covid-19\\r\\nPandemic, ChatGPT\\u2019s API returned a response with fabricated article titles and hyperlinks that\\r\\npurport to have been published by The Times.

These \\u201Challucinations\\u201D mislead users as to the source of the information they are\\r\\nobtaining, leading them to incorrectly believe that the information provided has been vetted and\\r\\npublished by The Times. Users who ask a search engine what The Times has written on a subject\\r\\nshould be provided with neither an unauthorized copy nor an inaccurate forgery of a Times article,\\r\\nbut a link to the article itself.\\r\\nF. Profit to Defendants\\r\\n143. Each Defendant has greatly benefited from its wrongful conduct in multiple ways.\\r\\n144. Each Defendant has reaped substantial savings by taking and using\\u2014at no cost\\u2014\\r\\nNew York Times content to create their LLMs. Times journalism is the work of thousands of\\r\\njournalists, whose employment costs hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Each Defendant has\\r\\n56\\r\\nwrongfully benefited from nearly a century of that work\\u2014some performed in harm\\u2019s way\\u2014that\\r\\nremains protected by copyright law. Defendants have effectively avoided spending the billions of\\r\\ndollars that The Times invested in creating that work by taking it without permission or\\r\\ncompensation.\\r\\n145. Times Works form an exceptionally valuable body of data for training seemingly\\r\\nknowledgeable and capable LLMs. Numerous metrics confirm that journalistic works in general\\r\\nand Times Works in particular are more valuable than most other content on the internet that may\\r\\nhave also been used to train and ground responses from the GPT models.\\r\\n146. Google PageRank, for example, measures the relative importance of webpages\\r\\nbased on the number of links pointing to them (\\u201Creferrals\\u201D). According to one PageRank list, The\\r\\nTimes has the 42nd highest PageRank value out of all websites as of December 21, 2023, and most\\r\\ndomains ranking higher than The Times are social media sites and other sites containing content\\r\\nthat would not be helpful for training a GenAI model because it has not been fact-checked and\\r\\ncarefully edited for tone and style.37 As of December 21, 2023, the only text-based content sites\\r\\nranking above The Times are Wikipedia, Wordpress, and Medium.38\\r\\n147. The value of Times content is further underscored by a Google search ranking\\r\\npatent that explicitly refers to The Times as a \\u201Cseed page\\u201D having high-quality pages. The New\\r\\nYork Times website is the only seed page explicitly named other than the Google Directory.39\\r\\n148. Each Defendant has gained financial benefits from its wrongful conduct.\\r\\n37 Top 10 Million Websites, DOMCOP, https:\\/\\/www.domcop.com\\/top-10-million-websites (last visited Dec.\\r\\n21, 2023).\\r\\n38 Id.\\r\\n39 U.S. Patent No. 9,165,040 (filed Oct. 20, 2015).\\r\\n57\\r\\n149. In April 2023, ChatGPT had approximately 173 million users.40 A subset of those\\r\\nusers pay for ChatGPT Plus, for which OpenAI charges users $20 per month.41 When announcing\\r\\nthe release of ChatGPT Enterprise, a subscription-based high-capability GPT-4 application\\r\\ntargeted at corporate clients, in August 2023, OpenAI claimed that teams in \\u201Cover 80% of Fortune\\r\\n500 companies\\u201D were using its products.42\\r\\n150. As of August 2023, OpenAI was on pace to generate more than $1 billion in revenue\\r\\nover the next twelve months, or $80 million in revenue per month.43\\r\\n151. The value of Microsoft\\u2019s investments in OpenAI have substantially increased over\\r\\ntime. Microsoft initially invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019, an investment that one publication\\r\\nhas said may be \\u201Cone of the shrewdest bets in tech history.\\u201D44 In 2021, OpenAI was valued at $14\\r\\nbillion; just two years later, in early 2023, it was valued at approximately $29 billion.45 Microsoft\\r\\neventually increased its investment in OpenAI to a reported $13 billion. It was reported in\\r\\nNovember 2023 that a planned sale of employee shares would be expected to place OpenAI\\u2019s\\r\\nvaluation at nearly $90 billion.46\\r\\n40 Nerdynav, 107 Up-to-Date ChatGPT Statistics & User Numbers [Dec 2023], NERDYNAV,\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/nerdynav.com\\/chatgpt-statistics\\/ (last updated Dec. 6, 2023).\\r\\n41 OpenAI, Introducing ChatGPT Plus, OPENAI (Feb. 1, 2023), https:\\/\\/openai.com\\/blog\\/chatgpt-plus.\\r\\n42 Introducing ChatGPT Enterprise, supra note 5.\\r\\n43 Amir Efrati & Aaron Holmes, OpenAI Passes $1 Billion Revenue Pace as Big Companies Boost AI\\r\\nSpending, THE INFORMATION (Aug. 29, 2023), https:\\/\\/www.theinformation.com\\/articles\\/openai-passes-1-billion-\\r\\nrevenue-pace-as-big-companies-boost-ai-spending.\\r\\n44 Hasan Chowdhury, Microsoft's Investment into ChatGPT's Creator May Be the Smartest $1 Billion Ever\\r\\nSpent, BUSINESS INSIDER (Jan. 6, 2023), https:\\/\\/www.businessinsider.com\\/microsoft-openai-investment-the-\\r\\nsmartest-1-billion-ever-spent-2023-1.\\r\\n45 Phil Rosen, ChatGPT's Creator OpenAI Has Doubled in Value Since 2021 as the Language Bot Goes\\r\\nViral and Microsoft Pours in $10 Billion, BUSINESS INSIDER (Jan. 24, 2023),\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/markets.businessinsider.com\\/news\\/stocks\\/chatgpt-openai-valuation-bot-microsoft-language-google-tech-\\r\\nstock-funding-2023-\\r\\n1#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20tech%20firm,%2410%20billion%20investment%20in%20OpenAI.\\r\\n46 Aditya Soni, Microsoft Emerges as Big Winner from OpenAI Turmoil, REUTERS (Nov. 20, 2023),\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.reuters.com\\/technology\\/microsoft-emerges-big-winner-openai-turmoil-with-altman-board-2023-11-20\\/.\\r\\n58\\r\\n152.

Defendants have no permission to copy,\\r\\nreproduce, and display Times content for free.\\r\\n155. A well-established market exists for The Times to provide paid access to and use of\\r\\nits works both by individual and institutional users. Unauthorized copying of Times Works without\\r\\npayment to train LLMs is a substitutive use that is not justified by any transformative purpose.\\r\\n156. As discussed above, The Times strictly limits the content it makes accessible for\\r\\nfree and prohibits the use of its material (whether free or paid for) for commercial uses absent a\\r\\nspecific authorization. Not only has it implemented a paywall, but it requires a license for entities\\r\\nthat wish to use its content for commercial purposes. These licenses, which place strict\\r\\nrequirements on what content is being licensed and for what purposes it may be used, generate\\r\\nmillions of dollars in revenue for The Times per year. Here, by contrast, Defendants have used\\r\\nalmost a century\\u2019s worth of copyrighted content, for which they have not paid The Times fair\\r\\ncompensation. This lost market value of The Times\\u2019s copyrighted content represents a significant\\r\\nharm to The Times caused by Defendants.\\r\\n157. If individuals can access The Times\\u2019s highly valuable content through Defendants\\u2019\\r\\nown products without having to pay for it and without having to navigate through The Times\\u2019s\\r\\npaywall, many will likely do so. Defendants\\u2019 unlawful conduct threatens to divert readers,\\r\\nincluding current and potential subscribers, away from The Times, thereby reducing the\\r\\nsubscription, advertising, licensing, and affiliate revenues that fund The Times\\u2019s ability to continue\\r\\nproducing its current level of groundbreaking journalism.\\r\\n60\\r\\nCOUNT I: Copyright Infringement (17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 501)\\r\\nAgainst All Defendants\\r\\n158. The Times incorporates by reference and realleges the preceding allegations as\\r\\nthough fully set forth herein.\\r\\n159. As the owner of the registered copyrights in the literary works copied to produce\\r\\nDefendants\\u2019 GPT models and, in many cases, distributed by and embedded within Defendants\\u2019\\r\\nGPT models, The Times holds the exclusive rights to those works under 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 106.\\r\\n160. By building training datasets containing millions of copies of Times Works,\\r\\nincluding by scraping copyrighted Times Works from The Times\\u2019s websites and reproducing such\\r\\nworks from third-party datasets, the OpenAI Defendants have directly infringed The Times\\u2019s\\r\\nexclusive rights in its copyrighted works.\\r\\n161. By storing, processing, and reproducing the training datasets containing millions of\\r\\ncopies of Times Works to train the GPT models on Microsoft\\u2019s supercomputing platform,\\r\\nMicrosoft and the OpenAI Defendants have jointly directly infringed The Times\\u2019s exclusive rights\\r\\nin its copyrighted works.\\r\\n162. On information and belief, by storing, processing, and reproducing the GPT models\\r\\ntrained on Times Works, which GPT models themselves have memorized, on Microsoft\\u2019s\\r\\nsupercomputing platform, Microsoft and the OpenAI Defendants have jointly directly infringed\\r\\nThe Times\\u2019s exclusive rights in its copyrighted works.\\r\\n163.

On information and belief, Defendants\\u2019 infringing conduct alleged herein was and\\r\\ncontinues to be willful and carried out with full knowledge of The Times\\u2019s rights in the copyrighted\\r\\nworks. As a direct result of their conduct, Defendants have wrongfully profited from copyrighted\\r\\nworks that they do not own.\\r\\n166. By and through the actions alleged above, Defendants have infringed and will\\r\\ncontinue to infringe The Times\\u2019s copyrights.\\r\\n167. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants\\u2019 infringing conduct alleged herein,\\r\\nThe Times has sustained and will continue to sustain substantial, immediate, and irreparable injury\\r\\nfor which there is no adequate remedy at law. Unless Defendants\\u2019 infringing conduct is enjoined\\r\\nby this Court, Defendants have demonstrated an intent to continue to infringe the copyrighted\\r\\nworks. The Times therefore is entitled to permanent injunctive relief restraining and enjoining\\r\\nDefendants\\u2019 ongoing infringing conduct.\\r\\n168. The Times is further entitled to recover statutory damages, actual damages,\\r\\nrestitution of profits, attorneys\\u2019 fees, and other remedies provided by law.\\r\\nCOUNT II: Vicarious Copyright Infringement\\r\\nAgainst Microsoft, OpenAI Inc., OpenAI GP, OpenAI LP, OAI Corporation LLC,\\r\\nOpenAI Holdings LLC, and OpenAI Global LLC\\r\\n169. The Times incorporates by reference and realleges the preceding allegations as\\r\\nthough fully set forth herein.\\r\\n170. Microsoft controlled, directed, and profited from the infringement perpetrated by\\r\\nthe OpenAI Defendants. Microsoft controls and directs the supercomputing platform used to store,\\r\\n62\\r\\nprocess, and reproduce the training datasets containing millions of Times Works, the GPT models,\\r\\nand OpenAI\\u2019s ChatGPT offerings. Microsoft profited from the infringement perpetrated by the\\r\\nOpenAI defendants by incorporating the infringing GPT models trained on Times Works into its\\r\\nown product offerings, including Bing Chat.\\r\\n171. Defendants OpenAI Inc., OpenAI GP, OAI Corporation LLC, OpenAI Holdings\\r\\nLLC, and Microsoft controlled, directed, and profited from the infringement perpetrated by\\r\\nDefendants OpenAI LP, OpenAI Global LLC, OpenAI OpCo LLC, and OpenAI, LLC, including\\r\\nthe reproduction and distribution of Times Works.\\r\\n172. Defendants OpenAI Global LLC and OpenAI LP directed, controlled, and profited\\r\\nfrom the infringement perpetrated by Defendants OpenAI OpCo LLC and OpenAI, LLC, including\\r\\nthe reproduction and distribution of Times Works.\\r\\n173. Defendants OpenAI Inc., OpenAI LP, OAI Corporation LLC, OpenAI Holdings\\r\\nLLC, OpenAI Global LLC, and Microsoft are vicariously liable for copyright infringement.\\r\\nCOUNT III: Contributory Copyright Infringement\\r\\nAgainst Microsoft\\r\\n174. The Times incorporates by reference and realleges the preceding allegations as\\r\\nthough fully set forth herein.\\r\\n175. Microsoft materially contributed to and directly assisted in the direct infringement\\r\\nattributable to the OpenAI Defendants.\\r\\n176. Microsoft provided the supercomputing infrastructure and directly assisted the\\r\\nOpenAI Defendants in: (i) building training datasets containing millions of copies of Times Works;\\r\\n(ii) storing, processing, and reproducing the training datasets containing millions of copies of\\r\\nTimes Works used to train the GPT models; (iii) providing the computing resources to host,\\r\\n63\\r\\noperate, and commercialize the GPT models and GenAI products; and (iv) providing the Browse\\r\\nwith Bing plug-in to facilitate infringement and generate infringing output.\\r\\n177. Microsoft knew or had reason to know of the direct infringement perpetrated by the\\r\\nOpenAI Defendants because Microsoft and OpenAI\\u2019s partnership extends to the development,\\r\\ncommercialization, and monetization of the OpenAI Defendants\\u2019 GPT-based products. Microsoft\\r\\nwas fully aware of the capabilities of OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-based products.\\r\\nCOUNT IV: Contributory Copyright Infringement\\r\\nAgainst All Defendants\\r\\n178. The Times incorporates by reference and realleges the preceding allegations as\\r\\nthough fully set forth herein.\\r\\n179. In the alternative, to the extent an end-user may be liable as a direct infringer based\\r\\non output of the GPT-based products, Defendants materially contributed to and directly assisted\\r\\nwith the direct infringement perpetrated by end-users of the GPT-based products by way of: (i)\\r\\njointly-developing LLM models capable of distributing unlicensed copies of Times Works to end-\\r\\nusers; (ii) building and training the GPT LLMs using Times Works; and (iii) deciding what content\\r\\nis actually outputted by the GenAI products, such as grounding output in Times Works through\\r\\nretrieval augmented generation, fine-tuning the models for desired outcomes, and\\/or selecting and\\r\\nweighting the parameters of the GPT LLMs.\\r\\n180. Defendants knew or had reason to know of the direct infringement by end-users\\r\\nbecause Defendants undertake extensive efforts in developing, testing, and troubleshooting their\\r\\nLLM models and GPT-based products. Defendants are fully aware that their GPT-based products\\r\\nare capable of distributing unlicensed copies or derivatives of copyrighted Times Works.\\r\\n64\\r\\nCOUNT V: Digital Millennium Copyright Act \\u2013 Removal of Copyright Management\\r\\nInformation (17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 1202)\\r\\nAgainst All Defendants\\r\\n181. The Times incorporates by reference and realleges the preceding allegations as\\r\\nthough fully set forth herein.\\r\\n182. The Times included one or more forms of copyright-management information in\\r\\neach of The Times\\u2019s infringed works, including: copyright notice, title and other identifying\\r\\ninformation, terms and conditions of use, and identifying numbers or symbols referring to the\\r\\ncopyright-management information.\\r\\n183. Without The Times\\u2019s authority, Defendants copied The Times\\u2019s works and used\\r\\nthem as training data for their GenAI models.\\r\\n184. Upon information and belief, Defendants removed The Times\\u2019s copyright-\\r\\nmanagement information in building the training datasets containing millions of copies of Times\\r\\nWorks, including removing The Times\\u2019s copyright-management information from Times Works\\r\\nscraped directly from The Times\\u2019s websites and removing The Times\\u2019s copyright-management\\r\\ninformation from Times Works reproduced from third-party datasets.\\r\\n185. Upon information and belief, Microsoft and OpenAI removed The Times\\u2019s\\r\\ncopyright-management information through generating synthetic search results, including\\r\\nremoving The Times\\u2019s copyright-management information when scraping Times Works from The\\r\\nTimes\\u2019s websites and generating copies or derivatives of Times Works as output for the Browse\\r\\nwith Bing and Bing Chat offerings.\\r\\n186. Microsoft and OpenAI removed The Times\\u2019s copyright-management information\\r\\nin generating outputs from the GPT models containing copies or derivatives of Times Works.\\r\\n65\\r\\n187. By design, the training process does not preserve any copyright-management\\r\\ninformation, and the outputs of Defendants\\u2019 GPT models removed any copyright notices, titles,\\r\\nand identifying information, despite the fact that those outputs were often verbatim reproductions\\r\\nof Times content. Therefore, Defendants intentionally removed copyright-management\\r\\ninformation from The Times\\u2019s works in violation of 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 1202(b)(1).\\r\\n188. Defendants\\u2019 removal or alteration of The Times's copyright-management\\r\\ninformation has been done knowingly and with the intent to induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal\\r\\ninfringement of The Times\\u2019s copyrights.\\r\\n189. Without The Times\\u2019s authority, Defendants created copies and derivative works\\r\\nbased on The Times\\u2019s works. By distributing these works without their copyright-management\\r\\ninformation, Defendants violated 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 1202(b)(3).\\r\\n190. Defendants knew or had reasonable grounds to know that their removal of\\r\\ncopyright-management information would facilitate copyright infringement by concealing the fact\\r\\nthat the GPT models are infringing copyrighted works and that output from the GPT models are\\r\\ninfringing copies and derivative works.\\r\\n191. The Times has been injured by Defendants\\u2019 removal of copyright-management\\r\\ninformation. The Times is entitled to statutory damages, actual damages, restitution of profits, and\\r\\nother remedies provided by law, including full costs and attorneys\\u2019 fees.\\r\\nCOUNT VI: Common Law Unfair Competition By Misappropriation\\r\\nAgainst All Defendants\\r\\n192. The Times incorporates by reference and realleges the preceding allegations as\\r\\nthough fully set forth herein.\\r\\n66\\r\\n193. The Times gathers information, which often takes the form of time-sensitive\\r\\nbreaking news, for its content at a substantial cost to The Times. Wirecutter likewise compiles and\\r\\nproduces time-sensitive recommendations for readers.\\r\\n194. By offering content that is created by GenAI but is the same or similar to content\\r\\npublished by The Times, Defendants\\u2019 GPT models directly compete with Times content.\\r\\nDefendants\\u2019 use of Times content encoded within models and live Times content processed by\\r\\nmodels produces outputs that usurp specific commercial opportunities of The Times, such as the\\r\\nrevenue generated by Wirecutter recommendations. For example, Defendants have not only copied\\r\\nTimes content, but also altered the content by removing links to the products, thereby depriving\\r\\nThe Times of the opportunity to receive referral revenue and appropriating that opportunity for\\r\\nDefendants.\\r\\n195. Defendants\\u2019 use of Times content to train models that produce informative text of\\r\\nthe same general type and kind that The Times produces competes with Times content for traffic.\\r\\n196. Defendants\\u2019 use of Times content without The Times\\u2019s consent to train Defendants\\u2019\\r\\nGenAI models constitutes free-riding on The Times\\u2019s significant efforts and investment of human\\r\\ncapital to gather this information.\\r\\n197. Defendants\\u2019 misuse and misappropriation of Times content has caused The Times\\r\\nto suffer actual damages from the deprivation of the benefits of its work, such as, without\\r\\nlimitation, lost advertising and affiliate referral revenue.\\r\\nCOUNT VII: Trademark Dilution (15 U.S.C. \\u00A7 1125(c))\\r\\nAgainst All Defendants\\r\\n198. The Times incorporates by reference and realleges the preceding allegations as\\r\\nthough fully set forth herein.\\r\\n67\\r\\n199. The Times is the owner of several federally registered trademarks, including U.S.\\r\\nRegistration No. 5,912,366 for the trademark \\u201CThe New York Times,\\u201D as well as the marks\\r\\n\\u201Cnytimes\\u201D (U.S. Reg. No. 3,934,613), and \\u201Cnytimes.com\\u201D (U.S. Reg. No. 3,934,612).\\r\\n200. The Times\\u2019s trademarks are distinctive and famous.\\r\\n201. Defendants have, in connection with the commerce of producing GenAI to users\\r\\nfor profit throughout the United States, including in New York, engaged in the unauthorized use\\r\\nof The Times\\u2019s trademarks in outputs generated by Defendants\\u2019 GPT-based products.\\r\\n202. Defendants\\u2019 unauthorized use of The Times\\u2019s marks on lower quality and inaccurate\\r\\nwriting dilutes the quality of The Times\\u2019s trademarks by tarnishment in violation of 15 U.S.C \\u00A7\\r\\n1125(c).\\r\\n203. Defendants are aware that their GPT-based products produce inaccurate content that\\r\\nis falsely attributed to The Times and yet continue to profit commercially from creating and\\r\\nattributing inaccurate content to The Times. As such, Defendants have intentionally violated 15\\r\\nU.S.C \\u00A7 1125(c).\\r\\n204. As an actual and proximate result of the unauthorized use of The Times\\u2019s\\r\\ntrademarks, The Times has suffered and continues to suffer harm by, among other things, damaging\\r\\nits reputation for accuracy, originality, and quality, which has and will continue to cause it\\r\\neconomic loss.\\r\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\\r\\nWHEREFORE, The Times demands judgment against each Defendant as follows:\\r\\n1. Awarding The Times statutory damages, compensatory damages, restitution,\\r\\ndisgorgement, and any other relief that may be permitted by law or equity;\\r\\n68\\r\\n2. Permanently enjoining Defendants from the unlawful, unfair, and infringing\\r\\nconduct alleged herein;\\r\\n3. Ordering destruction under 17 U.S.C. \\u00A7 503(b) of all GPT or other LLM models\\r\\nand training sets that incorporate Times Works;\\r\\n4. An award of costs, expenses, and attorneys\\u2019 fees as permitted by law; and\\r\\n5. Such other or further relief as the Court may deem appropriate, just, and equitable.\\r\\nDEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL\\r\\nThe Times hereby demands a jury trial for all claims so triable.\\r\\nDated: December 27, 2023 \\/s\\/ Elisha Barron\\r\\nIan Crosby (pro hac vice forthcoming)\\r\\nSUSMAN GODFREY L.L.P.\\r\\n401 Union Street, Suite 3000\\r\\nSeattle, WA 98101\\r\\nTelephone: (206) 516-3880\\r\\nFacsimile: (206) 516-3883\\r\\nicrosby@susmangodfrey.com\\r\\nDavida Brook (pro hac vice forthcoming)\\r\\nEllie Dupler (pro hac vice forthcoming)\\r\\nSUSMAN GODFREY L.L.P.\\r\\n1900 Ave of the Stars, Suite 1400\\r\\nLos Angeles, CA 90067\\r\\nTelephone: (310) 789-3100\\r\\nFacsimile: (310) 789-3150\\r\\ndbrook@susmangodfrey.com\\r\\nedupler@susmangodfrey.com\\r\\nElisha Barron (5036850)\\r\\nTamar Lusztig (5125174)\\r\\nSUSMAN GODFREY L.L.P.\\r\\n1301 Avenue of the Americas, 32nd Floor\\r\\nNew York, NY 10019\\r\\nTelephone: (212) 336-8330\\r\\nFacsimile: (212) 336-8340\\r\\nebarron@susmangodfrey.com\\r\\ntlusztig@susmangodfrey.com\\r\\n69\\r\\nSteven Lieberman (SL8687)\\r\\nJennifer B.
