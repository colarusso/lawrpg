Q(start): What role are you playing today?
A: The Judge
	Q(1.1):GOTO:judge
A: An attorney
	Q(1.2):GOTO:attorney
A: A fractional judge
	Q(1.3):GOTO:fractional

Q(judge): Great, I'll help you guide gameplay. Before we start, how many people in your group, including yourself?
X:
	Q(DC): Do you have two attorneys? 
	A: Yes
		Q(2.1.1):GOTO:sim
	A: No
		Q(2.1.2): Ask for volunteers, if you can't easily decide on two attorneys, have everyone role their D20. The two people with the highest rolls are the two attorneys. To break any ties, have folks roll again. Once you have your attorneys, click Continue.
		A: Continue
			Q(2.1.2.1):GOTO:sim

Q(sim): Today's simulation is either: <br><br>A hearing involving the request for a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preliminary_injunction" target="_blank">preliminary injunction</a>. The plaintiff will need to show that: (1) their client faces irreparable injury; (2) they are likely to succeed on the merits; (3) the balance of equities and hardships is in their client's favor; and (4) the injunction is in the public interest. OR<br><br>A hearing for a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/motion_to_dismiss" target="_blank">motion to dismiss</a>, probably focusing on a failure to state a claim. This means the defendant probably needs to show "that even if all the factual allegations in a complaint are true, they are insufficient to establish a cause of action..."<br><br>
Your job is to work through the relevant elements. 
A: Got it
	Q(3.1): Have the plaintiff (PI) or defendant (MTD) start by explaining why either: their client(s) face irreparable injury should the court fail to grant the injunction OR why the allegations presented are insufficient to support an elements of the complaint. Ask their opponents to counter, and make sure both sides have their chance to rebut. Feel free to push back and ask clarifying questions. GOTO:votes

Q(votes): Once they've finished. Poll the fractional judges (everyone but the attorneys and yourself) to see how many of them think the NON-moving party should prevail. Record the votes below.
X[javascript:getDC()]:
	Q(4.1):Have the moving party roll their D20. To succeed, they need to roll <b><x>DC</x></b> or higher.
	A[javascript:goto(dice(20,'jroll'))]: I need to roll for them
	A: They succeeded
		Q(4.1.2): Narrate their success. GOTO:again
	A: They failed
		Q(4.1.3): Narrate their failure. GOTO:again

Q(jroll): <span class="dice"><x>start</x></span>
A: They succeeded
	Q(5.1): Narrate their success. GOTO:again
A: They failed
	Q(5.2): Narrate their failure. GOTO:again

Q(again): Choose the next element and have the attorneys argue the issue. Decide who you want to have to roll and ask the fractional judges if they think their opponent will prevail. Record the votes below.
X[javascript:getDC()]:
	Q(6.1):Have the attorney roll their D20. To succeed, they need to roll <b><x>DC</x></b> or higher.
	A[javascript:goto(dice(20,'jroll'))]: I need to roll for them
	A: They succeeded
		Q(6.1.2): Narrate their success. GOTO:again
	A: They failed
		Q(6.1.3): Narrate their failure. GOTO:again
A: We don't have any more arguments
	Q(6.2): Report back your results. You're all done.

Q(attorney): Pick your case type. 
A: preliminary injunction
	Q(7.1):GOTO:PI
A: motion to dismiss
	Q(7.2):GOTO:MTD

Q(PI):Are you arguing for the plaintiff or the defendant?
A: plaintiff
	Q(8.1): This is an emergency hearing in which you are asking for a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preliminary_injunction" target="_blank">preliminary injunction</a>. You will need to show that: (1) your client faces irreparable injury; (2) you are likely to succeed on the merits; (3) the balance of equities and hardships is in your client's favor; and (4) the injunction is in the public interest. <br><br> If you have questions about your arguments or the facts, you should consult case materials for your case linked above. I suggest starting with the Question & Distill tool.GOTO:dice

A: defendant
	Q(8.2): This is an emergency hearing in which the plaintiff is asking for a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preliminary_injunction" target="_blank">preliminary injunction</a>. They will need to show that: (1) their client faces irreparable injury; (2) they are likely to succeed on the merits; (3) the balance of equities and hardships is in their client's favor; and (4) the injunction is in the public interest. <br><br> If you have questions about your arguments or the facts, you should consult case materials for your case linked above. I suggest starting with the Question & Distill tool.GOTO:dice

Q(MTD):Are you arguing for the plaintiff or the defendant?
A: plaintiff
	Q(9.1): This is a hearing for a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/motion_to_dismiss" target="_blank">motion to dismiss</a>, probably focusing on a failure to state a claim. This means the defendant probably needs to show "that even if all the factual allegations in a complaint are true, they are insufficient to establish a cause of action..." <br><br> If you have questions about your arguments or the facts, you should consult case materials for your case linked above. I suggest starting with the Question & Distill tool.GOTO:dice

A: defendant
	Q(9.2): This is a hearing for a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/motion_to_dismiss" target="_blank">motion to dismiss</a>, probably focusing on a failure to state a claim. This means you probably need to show "that even if all the factual allegations in a complaint are true, they are insufficient to establish a cause of action..." <br><br> If you have questions about your arguments or the facts, you should consult case materials for your case linked above. I suggest starting with the Question & Distill tool.GOTO:dice

Q(dice): If you need to roll a D20, go ahead.
A[javascript:goto(dice(20,'rolled'))]: Roll

Q(rolled): <span class="dice"><x>start</x></span>
A[javascript:goto(dice(20,'rolled'))]: Roll

Q(fractional): Your job is pretty straightforward. All you have to do is listen to the arguments from both attorneys and vote on which ones should prevail when polled by The Judge. That's it. <br><br> For context, today's simulation is either: (1) an emergency hearing in which the plaintiff is asking for a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preliminary_injunction" target="_blank">preliminary injunction</a>; or (2) a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/motion_to_dismiss" target="_blank">motion to dismiss</a>, probably focusing on a failure to state a claim. This means the defendant probably needs to show "that even if all the factual allegations in a complaint are true, they are insufficient to establish a cause of action..."
